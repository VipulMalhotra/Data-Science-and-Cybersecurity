The 12-to-11 vote “moves us one step closer to a simpler, fairer, and more transparent tax system,” Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi said in a statement.  The full Senate is expected to begin debating the tax bill and vote on it sometime this week.

0,True,"November 28, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday he was offended by claims that the State Department is being hollowed out, saying his agency is functioning well, contrary to scathing criticism from former diplomats. In the latest salvo, two retired senior U.S. diplomats said the agency is being undermined by proposed budget cuts of about 30 percent and is being deliberately taken apart. “President Trump’s draconian budget cuts for the State Department and his dismissive attitude toward our diplomats and diplomacy itself threaten to dismantle a great Foreign Service,” Nicholas Burns and Ryan Crocker wrote in the New York Times on Monday. “This is not about belt tightening. It is a deliberate effort to deconstruct the State Department and the Foreign Service,” Burns, a former No. 3 official at the agency, and Crocker, a six-time U.S. ambassador, added. The forcing out of many senior diplomats, the failure to nominate or to win Senate confirmation for officials to fill many major agency roles, and a perception that Tillerson is inaccessible have eroded morale, according to current officials. Tillerson said, however, the department is running well and that the department budget had grown dramatically. The planned cuts would restore it to historical norms, he said. He also praised officials serving as acting assistant secretaries of state, typically among the agency’s key jobs, saying they have helped to devise approaches on issues from North Korea and Syria to Iran and Ukraine. “There is no hollowing out,” Tillerson said after a speech at a think tank. “I am offended on their behalf when people say, somehow, we don’t have a State Department that functions ... I can tell you, it’s functioning very well from my perspective.” Tillerson said the process of winning Senate confirmation of appointments has been “excruciatingly slow.” However, the Trump administration has failed to nominate people to serve in many key agency slots, leaving the Senate unable to consider them. According to a database compiled by the Washington Post newspaper and the nonprofit, nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, there are no nominees for the assistant secretaries of state for African, East Asian, South and Central Asian, Near Eastern or Western Hemisphere affairs.  This means that the top diplomats for major regions do not enjoy status that comes from being chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

0,True,"November 28, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Puerto Rico would get substantial debt relief and other new aid to help it recover from destruction inflicted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria in September, under legislation unveiled on Tuesday by leading liberals in the U.S. Senate. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent, and Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat, called for a new “emergency credit facility” of up to $57.2 billion for Puerto Rico and $5 billion for the Virgin Islands, according to a summary of the bill. The bill would also extend the deadline for individuals to apply for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The legislation cannot advance without the support of Republicans, who hold a slim majority in the Senate. Congressional Republicans and the Trump administration have approved some $51 billion in aid to the U.S. territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands and U.S. states hit by hurricanes and wildfires, with a new round expected to be approved in December. The effort has been criticized as lackluster by many Democrats in Congress, with large swaths of Puerto Rico still without power and clean water. Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello is seeking more than $94 billion in disaster recovery aid, including $31.1 billion for housing and $17.8 billion to rebuild and bolster the power grid. The legislation would put Congress on record in support of relieving Puerto Rico’s $72 billion debt. The island has a further $50 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. Kenneth Mapp, governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, said the island had requested $7.5 billion to cover uninsured hurricane-related damages to the public sector. The hurricanes devastated the island’s healthcare sector, destroying two already struggling hospitals. Mapp also asked for a waiver to use $226 million in unspent Medicaid funding provided under Obamacare. The island was unable to spend the money because the local government could not provide its share of matching funds. The Sanders-Warren plan would also restore the U.S. minimum wage for certain young workers in Puerto Rico, open some federal food and nutrition programs to the two territories and improve benefits under the Medicare and Medicaid health programs. The legislation as well would provide more federal aid for rebuilding Puerto Rico’s electric grid, with an emphasis on beefing up solar, wind and other “clean” energy capabilities.

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The fight for control of the U.S. consumer watchdog agency intensified on Monday as Mick Mulvaney, President Donald Trump’s pick to run the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), imposed a hiring freeze and halted any new regulations. In a partisan showdown over the CFPB, which was created to crack down on predatory financial practices, Mulvaney is being sued by Leandra English, an Obama-era appointee to the agency who argues that she is the consumer bureau’s rightful leader. The conflict began on Friday when Richard Cordray, a Democrat appointed CFPB director by then-President Barack Obama, formally resigned and named English, his chief of staff, as acting director. Hours later, Trump named Mulvaney, the current director of the White House budget office, as temporary head of the CFPB. The Republican president has a right to name a permanent CFPB director, officials agree. There are dueling claims, however, about who gets to lead the agency in the meantime. Both sides presented their arguments during an emergency U.S. District Court hearing in Washington on Monday. Timothy Kelly, a Trump-appointed judge who is presiding over the case, said the issues raised were “extremely important and complicated.” The judge as well as the two sides said they hoped to see the case decided within the next few days. The next step is for the Trump administration to submit its response to English’s suit. The fight to control the 1,600-employee agency lays bare deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats over how to regulate Wall Street and protect consumers, following the 2007-2009 financial crisis that cost taxpayers $700 billion in bailouts. Republicans loathe the CFPB, saying it wields too much power and burdens banks and other lenders with unnecessary red tape. Mulvaney, who sought to dismantle the CFPB when he was a Republican congressman, acknowledged at a news briefing on Monday afternoon that the Trump administration had a “dramatically different” interpretation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB. He said there would be a 30-day freeze on hiring at the agency and no payments from the CFPB’s civil penalties fund for that amount of time as well, except as required legally. All new regulations would also be frozen, he said.     “The president has made it very clear he wants me here. ... I want to be here. I don’t want anything coming out of here that I don’t know about,” Mulvaney said. Earlier on Monday, English welcomed staff back from the Thanksgiving holiday in a morning email and signed off as “acting director.” Around the same time, Mulvaney arrived at Cordray’s former office, bringing doughnuts for the staff.     “Please disregard any instructions you receive from Ms. English in her presumed capacity as Acting Director,” he wrote in an all-staff email seen by Reuters that he also signed “acting director.” Mulvaney advised staff members to inform the agency’s general counsel if they heard additional communications from English. As Mulvaney was getting settled in, a source told Reuters, CFPB general counsel Mary McLeod sent a memo agreeing with the U.S. Justice Department that Trump had the power to appoint Mulvaney as temporary leader of the watchdog. English went to the CFPB in the morning, according to her lawyer. She then met on Capitol Hill with Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who conceived the CFPB. English told reporters that “Mulvaney has no authority” at the agency. Schumer said on the Senate floor that the Dodd-Frank law, which he helped to write, set up a “clear” succession process for the CFPB that made English the acting director. Schumer said Mulvaney was chosen by the Trump administration simply to “rock the agency from the inside.” Trump campaigned for president saying Wall Street “gets away with murder,” but he also promised to defang or abolish the CFPB.     Since taking office, Trump has tried to undo a number of his Democratic predecessor’s initiatives, mostly notably the 2010 Affordable Care Act that the Republican-controlled Congress has been unable to repeal and replace. Cordray developed a reputation for drafting aggressive rules curbing products such as payday loans, while issuing multimillion-dollar fines against large financial institutions such as Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N).      Stock prices of major U.S. banks are trading near all-time highs. The KBW Bank Index .BKX has more than doubled since July 2011, when the CFPB opened for business. The drama over the CFPB came as the Senate was preparing to consider a bill that would significantly ease rules on some banks for the first time since the financial crisis.      Moderate Democrats and Republicans have come out in support of the package, aimed primarily at smaller and mid-sized banks, but analysts warned the CFPB fight could imperil that compromise. The Senate Banking Committee is supposed to take up the bill next week. ","Trump-installed consumer agency head sets hiring freeze, halts new rules"

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"HENAGAR, Ala. (Reuters) - Embattled Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore said on Monday the allegations of sexual misconduct against him were evidence of the moral failings of leaders in Washington and meant to distract attention from the real issues. Hitting the campaign trail for the first time in more than two weeks, when the charges first disrupted the race, Moore said the allegations were false and malicious and politicians in both parties were desperate to see him fail. “This is simply dirty politics. It’s a sign of the immorality of our times,” Moore told about 125 supporters who jammed a rural community center in northeast Alabama, speaking just over two weeks before a Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed U.S. attorney general earlier this year. Republican lawmakers in Washington, including Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, have rushed to distance themselves from Moore and called for him to step down from the race after he was accused by several women of sexual assault and misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his early 30s. Reuters has not been able to independently verify those allegations. Moore said the allegations were designed to distract from “the true issues” facing people and that Senate leaders understood he was difficult to manage and did not want to deal with him. “Politicians will stop at nothing to win an election,” said Moore, who has accused the media of joining in the effort to malign him. Outside the rally, a man wearing a Moore sticker pushed away a cameraman as he attempted to film Moore’s arrival, local media reported. A reporter for the Birmingham News, in a tweet, identified the man as Tony Goolsby, the DeKalb County chairman for the Moore campaign. President Donald Trump defended Moore last week, but a White House official said Trump would not campaign for Moore before the Dec. 12 special election. Trump has repeatedly slammed Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney, calling him a liberal and saying that Jones would not vote for a tax overhaul plan now being debated in Congress. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate and are eager to maintain their advantage to pass Trump’s legislative agenda on taxes, healthcare and other priorities. But Republican Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama told reporters on Monday he had not voted for Moore, writing in a candidate instead. He did not say whom he wrote in. Moore had largely stayed off the campaign trail and avoided questions since the allegations first surfaced in the Washington Post. The Jones campaign has taken notice and begun criticizing his absence. Before the rally, a Moore representative warned the crowd against any “outbursts” and said Moore would not be taking questions.

0,True,"November 28, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. official overseeing a reorganization of the State Department that has been criticized by current and former U.S. diplomats has stepped down after less than four months on the job, U.S. officials said on Monday. Maliz Beams, a former financial industry executive who was named State Department counselor on Aug. 17, is “stepping away” to return to Boston, said a department spokesman on condition of anonymity. Christine Ciccone, the department’s deputy chief of staff, will take over the agency’s “redesign,” he added. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has been criticized by current and former U.S. diplomats as well as by some members of Congress for his management of the agency, where may top posts have not been filled nearly 10 months into Tillerson’s tenure. The department has also seen an exodus of senior diplomats. Tillerson defended the department when he was recently asked about morale problems and concerns that the agency was being weakened. “The redesign is going to address all of that. And this department is performing extraordinarily well, and I take exception to anyone who characterizes otherwise. It’s just not true,” he said on Nov. 20. State Department officials observing the reorganization say it has been plagued with uncertainty both about what Tillerson wants to achieve and how to go about it. “If the one thing she (Beams) was asked to do was the redesign and she is quitting ... how does this not reflect poorly on the overall management of this enterprise, that is the redesign?” said one official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Another State Department official said Beams had left of her own volition and was not fired. Beams did not immediately respond to voicemails left at her office and Massachusetts phone numbers or to an email sent to her State Department address. The State Department spokesman declined comment on criticism of the reorganization. A congressional aide said the effort is so amorphous that Congress is unable to pass legislation to give the agency the legal authority to make changes. “To do that we would need to have some road map - something - and none of that has been provided,” said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate Republican tax bill strongly backed by President Donald Trump faced potential opposition on Monday from two Republican lawmakers who could prevent the sweeping legislation from reaching the Senate floor. Senators Ron Johnson and Bob Corker, both members of the Senate Budget Committee, said they could vote against the tax package at a Tuesday hearing that Republican leaders hoped would send the legislation to a full Senate vote as early as Thursday. Each senator is seeking different changes to the legislation.  Their opposition could create the first major hurdle for the Republican tax overhaul in the Senate, where political infighting killed the party’s effort to overturn the Obamacare healthcare law earlier this year. Corker, a prominent deficit hawk, said he wants his fellow Republicans to add a backstop measure to prevent tax cuts from ballooning the deficit. Johnson said he wants a bigger tax break for “pass-through” businesses, which include small mom-and-pop enterprises as well as some large, non-corporate businesses. “If we develop a fix prior to committee, I’ll probably support it, but if we don’t, I’ll vote against it,” Johnson’s office quoted him telling reporters in his home state of Wisconsin. Republicans have only a one-vote majority on the 23-member budget committee.  The potential “no” votes surfaced after Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimated the Republican bill would expand the $20 trillion national debt by $1.4 trillion over a decade. Republicans have said that economic growth spurred by tax cuts would generate enough new tax revenue to eliminate any new deficit. But Corker said JCT is not expected to release a full macroeconomic analysis of the tax bill ahead of a Senate vote, making a safeguard provision necessary. “I’m not threatening anything. I’m just saying it’s very important for me to know that we’ve got this resolved,” Corker told reporters. Asked if he could vote no on the tax bill at the committee hearing, he replied: “Very possible. Yeah. Sure.” Corker and other Republican deficit hawks, including Senator James Lankford, have been holding talks with Senate tax writers and the administration about adding a provision that would raise tax rates if revenues fall short of expectations.   “We can’t afford to ignore the debt and deficit issues,” Lankford told reporters. “To me, the big issue is how are we dealing with debt and deficit, do we have realistic numbers and is there a backstop in the process just in case we don’t.” Republicans see the tax bill as their last chance to score a significant legislative achievement in 2017 and save face with voters in next year’s congressional midterm elections. Since Trump took office in January, he and his fellow Republicans have passed no major legislation, despite controlling both chambers of Congress and the White House. The Senate bill would slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent after a one-year delay. It would impose a one-time, cut-rate tax on corporations’ foreign profits, while exempting future foreign profits from U.S. taxation. Financial markets have rallied since Trump’s stunning 2016 election victory, partly on hopes of tax cuts for businesses. The Senate bill would deliver these, although its impact on individual Americans and families would be more mixed. Meanwhile, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), another nonpartisan research unit of Congress, said the number of Americans with health insurance would fall by 13 million by 2027 under the Republican tax bill, which would repeal an Obamacare federal fine meant to encourage people to buy health insurance. Such a change would shrink the supply of healthy, young people insured and drive up healthcare insurance premiums. The CBO said this would make people with incomes below $30,000 net losers under the bill. Most of those earning more would be net winners, especially those with incomes between $100,000 and $500,000, it said. Democrats, who call the bill a give-away to the rich and corporations, are expected to oppose it in the Senate. The House of Representatives approved a tax bill by a 227-205 vote on Nov. 16. No Democrats voted for it. Thirteen Republicans opposed it. If the Senate Budget Committee approves the tax bill on Tuesday, it will allow Republicans to use a parliamentary procedure known as reconciliation to pass the measure on a simple majority in the 100-seat Senate, which they control by a slim 52-48 margin. Without reconciliation, the legislation would need 60 votes, allowing Democrats to prevent its passage.   Senate Republican leaders did not appear on Monday to have enough votes to pass the legislation, with about a half-dozen Republicans viewed as potential “no” votes. But in a positive sign for Trump’s agenda, Republican Senator Rand Paul said on Monday he would support the bill. Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has also signaled support.

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said there was a “Pocahontas” in the U.S. Congress during a meeting on Monday with Native American World War Two veterans in an apparent derogatory reference to Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts. After listening to one veteran speak at length about his experience as a “Navajo code talker” during the war, Trump heaped praise on the veterans and said he would not give prepared remarks himself. “You were here long before any of us were here,” Trump said. “Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas.” Trump repeatedly referred to Warren as “Pocahontas,” the name of a famous 17th-century Native American, during his presidential campaign in a mocking reference to Warren’s having said in the past that she had Native American ancestry. Warren, one of the Senate’s most prominent liberal Democrats, is a noted legal scholar who taught at Harvard Law School and served as an adviser to former President Barack Obama before she was elected to the Senate in 2012. “It is deeply unfortunate that the president of the United States cannot even make it through a ceremony honoring these heroes without having to throw out a racial slur,” Warren said on MSNBC. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders disputed the characterization of Trump’s remark as a racial slur. “I think what most people find offensive is Senator Warren lying about her heritage to advance her career,” Sanders told reporters. Jefferson Keel, president of the National Congress of American Indians, questioned the “use of the name Pocahontas as a slur ... Once again, we call upon the president to refrain from using her name in a way that denigrates her legacy.”   Trump’s comment immediately trended on social media. The word “Pocahontas” appeared 12 times on Twitter every second, according to social media analytics company Zoomph. Trump’s knock at Warren came as his administration is embroiled in controversy over the Consumer Financial Protection Board, which Warren helped develop before entering politics.  The agency, set up to protect Americans from abusive lending practices after the financial crisis, has been under attack by Trump since he took office in January. On Friday, Trump named his budget director as the interim head of the agency, after its outgoing chief named someone else to the job, setting up a court battle.

Previously, the newspaper reported that Bocanegra had been disciplined by the state for inappropriate behavior in 2009. Reuters has not independently confirmed the allegations.

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic Senator Al Franken returned to Congress on Monday to begin what he called a process of rebuilding trust shattered by allegations he had groped or inappropriately touched women, vowing “this will not happen again.” “I know that I am going to have to be much more conscious when in these circumstances, much more careful, much more sensitive and that this will not happen again going forward,” he told reporters outside his office on Capitol Hill. Franken has been accused of sexual misconduct by Leann Tweeden, a radio broadcaster who in 2006 appeared with Franken in an entertainment tour for U.S. troops serving in war zones. Prior to winning his Senate seat, Franken was a well-known comedian, television writer and author. Another woman, Lindsay Menz, accused Franken of touching her buttocks when they were being photographed at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. A contrite Franken appeared on Monday before a throng of reporters gathered outside his office as the senator vowed to get back to work following a week-long Senate Thanksgiving break. “I know there are no magic words that I can say to regain your trust and I know that’s going to take time. I’m ready to start that process and it starts with going back to work today,” Franken said, apparently addressing his Minnesota constituents back home. Franken, first elected in 2008, is not due to run for a third Senate term until 2020. Following sexual misconduct allegations against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, additional complaints have been made regarding other big names in entertainment and in politics, notably Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama,                                                                           and Representative John Conyers of Michigan. All three men have denied the allegations, which Reuters has not been able to verify, and Conyers has stepped down as senior Democrat on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee.    In November, 2008, Franken barely won election in a race so close that it took vote recounts and court rulings before he finally was declared the winner the following July. Because of the closeness of his race and his background in entertainment and not government service, Franken came to the Senate refusing most media interviews. He kept a low profile while he tried to demonstrate to constituents that he was serious about his new political career. Eight years later, Franken is again having to prove himself with Minnesotans. Noting that his supporters had “counted on me to be a champion for women,” Franken again apologized for his behavior.

MONDAY, NOV. 27: President Donald Trump discusses a tax overhaul over lunch with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, the Republican-controlled chamber’s top tax writer, and four other Republican members of Hatch’s panel: John Cornyn, Rob Portman, Pat Toomey and Tim Scott.   Senate reconvenes after a week-long holiday break.  TUESDAY, NOV 28: Trump joins Senate Republicans at their weekly policy luncheon to urge quick passage of tax legislation. Trump also meets with Republican and Democratic leaders of both the Senate and House of Representatives to talk about funding legislation and other priorities.   The Senate Budget Committee holds a hearing on whether Republican tax legislation meets Senate rules for fast-track reconciliation bills. If it does, the bill could be introduced on the Senate floor later on Tuesday, beginning debate.    THURSDAY, NOV. 30, or FRIDAY, DEC. 1: Possible, although far from certain, final Senate vote on tax bill. FRIDAY, DEC. 8: Expiration date for funding needed to keep the U.S. government open. Congress has three choices: approve a massive bill for more than $1 trillion to keep the government operating through Sept. 30, 2018; pass a shorter extension of current funding to buy more time; or fail to pass anything and risk a partial government shutdown, stalling the tax effort. U.S. Treasury hits its limit on borrowing, but takes steps to postpone any need for action by Congress, eliminating any need for a debt limit increase in an end-of-year catch-all bill. TUESDAY, DEC. 12: Special U.S. Senate election in Alabama pits Republican Roy Moore, a conservative firebrand accused of sexual misconduct involving teen-age girls, against Democrat Doug Jones. The election could mean trouble for the tax overhaul effort. Moore, a critic of Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, could cause turmoil if elected. A win by Jones would shrink even more Republicans’ narrow margin of Senate control, which now stands at 52-48. THURSDAY, DEC. 14: House’s last scheduled session of 2017.  FRIDAY, DEC. 15: Senate’s last scheduled session of 2017. FRIDAY, DEC. 22: The last weekday before Christmas, and a potential deadline for sending tax legislation to Trump. DISASTER AID: On Nov. 17, the White House asked Congress to approve $45 billion in more aid for disaster-hit Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Texas, Florida and other states. If approved, as expected, aid would total nearly $96 billion. Additional requests are expected. DREAMERS: Trump has threatened to end an Obama-era program that helped “Dreamers,” people brought illegally into the United States when they were children. Trump gave Congress until early March to come up with a replacement program, but Democrats and some Republicans want to do this in December. CHIP: The Children’s Health Insurance Program, which helps millions of lower-income pregnant women and children, is running out of money. Congress has struggled to approve a five-year renewal for the program that normally enjoys bipartisan support. ","Factbox: From taxes to budget, what's on U.S. Congress to-do list"
0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Republican Senator Rand Paul said on Monday he will vote for a tax bill headed to the U.S. Senate floor for debate this week, settling questions about his support for the measure, although several other senators’ positions on it were still uncertain. President Donald Trump and Republican leaders in Congress want to pass tax legislation by the end of 2017. The House of Representatives has approved its own bill. Republicans control the Senate by a 52-48 margin, leaving little room for defections. Here is a list of Republicans whose votes could be pivotal to the bill’s fate. Paul, a fiscal hawk with a libertarian streak who sometimes strays from the party line, said on Monday he planned to vote for the tax bill, which was headed soon to the Senate floor. In a Fox News online opinion piece, Paul said the bill was not perfect and he would “prefer a larger cut,” but that he planned to back it because it achieved some of his goals and he could push for more changes next year. “I plan to vote for this bill as it stands right now,” wrote Paul, of Kentucky. Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin surprised colleagues earlier this month by becoming the first Republican to announce opposition to the tax plan. That earned him a telephone call from Trump. Johnson, formerly chief executive of a polyester and plastics manufacturer, said the legislation unfairly helps corporations over small businesses. But he has said he hopes changes could be made to win his support. Susan Collins, a moderate Maine Republican, has said she has qualms about Senate leaders’ plan to include repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate in the tax bill. The mandate requires people to buy health insurance or face a penalty. Collins said her staff’s research showed that for some middle-class Americans, higher insurance costs stemming from repeal of the individual mandate would outweigh the benefits of the tax cuts they would receive. She was among three Republicans who voted in July to block a Republican attempt to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Senator Bob Corker, a Trump critic who has decided not to run for re-election, has not taken a position on the tax bill. As a deficit hawk, Corker’s main concern is red ink - the tax bill is expected to add $1.5 trillion to the national debt over 10 years. Corker and Trump have openly feuded in recent weeks, with Corker calling the White House an “adult day care center” after Trump attacked Corker repeatedly on Twitter.     Senator John McCain of Arizona, a maverick and former presidential nominee, says he will wait for the final version of the tax-cut bill before announcing his position. The war hero infuriated Trump when he joined Collins and Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in voting against the Senate bill last summer to repeal Obamacare. McCain, who is still working after a diagnosis of brain cancer, has said he has almost no working relationship with  Trump and has criticized the administration. Murkowski of Alaska chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and wants to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, or ANWR, to oil and gas drilling. That provides an enticement for her to support the tax bill. Her committee has passed legislation to open the refuge to oil drilling, and the measure is expected to be attached to the tax bill. But Murkowski voted against three attempts to dismantle Obamacare in the summer, so the combination of the tax bill with a repeal of the Obamacare individual mandate may give her pause. Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona, a vocal Trump critic who is not seeking re-election in 2018, has issued a statement saying he appreciated the effort to fix the tax code but was worried about the impact on the national debt. Senator James Lankford of Oklahoma, is a conservative Republican, like Flake. Lankford has been in talks with Flake and others about opposing the tax plan on the grounds that it would balloon the national deficit, Time magazine has reported.

0,True,"November 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Al Franken, trying to salvage his political career amid accusations of groping or inappropriately touching women, said on Sunday he does not plan to resign but called himself “embarrassed and ashamed.” Franken, a Democrat and former comedian who has represented Minnesota in the Senate since 2009, said in a round of media interviews - his first since the allegations surfaced on Nov. 16 - that he looked forward to returning to his job on Monday. “I’m embarrassed and ashamed. I’ve let a lot of people down and I’m hoping I can make it up to them and gradually regain their trust,” Franken told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. Franken resisted comparisons between his behavior and that of Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for a U.S. Senate seat from Alabama who has been accused of improper conduct involving teenage girls decades ago.  “I’m going to take responsibility. I’m going to be held accountable through the ethics committee,” said Franken, whose behavior is being investigated by the Senate ethics panel. “And I’m going to hopefully be a voice in this that is helpful... Again, I respect women. What kills me about this is it gives people a reason to believe I don’t respect women.” Franken told Minneapolis television station WCCO in another interview that his predicament was “a bitter irony” because he has championed women’s’ issues and has employed them in both his campaign and Senate offices. “I’ve put them (women) in the highest jobs in my office,” he said. In a separate interview with Minnesota Public Radio, Franken, one of the leading liberal voices in the Senate, said has no plans to quit. When asked if he had considered resigning, Franken said: “No, no. The ethics committee is looking into this and I will cooperate fully with it.” Pressed about stepping aside and allowing a woman to take his seat, Franken told Minnesota Public Radio, “I’m committed to working as hard as I can here in the Senate for the people of Minnesota.” Franken’s office had previously issued statements in which he either apologized or said he could not remember behaving in the manner the women have described. He has not denied any of the allegations. Franken was first accused of sexual misconduct by radio broadcaster Leann Tweeden. She said Franken had forcibly kissed her during a 2006 USO war zone tour, and a photo showed him with his hands over her chest while she was sleeping. Four days later, a woman named Lindsay Menz told CNN that Franken had touched her buttocks while the two were being photographed in 2010 at the Minnesota State Fair. Franken has apologized to Tweeden, and has said he does not remember the incident with Menz. Last week, two other women told the Huffington Post Franken had touched their buttocks in separate incidents. The article did not provide the names of those two accusers. “I don’t remember these photographs, I don’t,” Franken told the Star Tribune. “This is not something I would intentionally do.” “I have been reflecting on this,” Franken told Minnesota Public Radio of the allegations. “I want to be a better man.” Franken is among a long list of celebrities and politicians who have been accused of sexual misconduct. The recent wave of accusations, some of them dating back decades, began in October. ",'Ashamed' Franken says he won't quit Senate over groping accusations

Paul, writing in a Fox News online opinion piece, said that while the bill was not perfect and he would “prefer a larger cut,” he planned to support the measure because it achieved some of his goals, and he could push for more changes next year. “This tax bill is a true test for my colleagues,” wrote Paul, who represents Kentucky. “I’m not getting everything I want — far from it. But I’ve been immersed in this process. I’ve fought for and received major changes for the better — and I plan to vote for this bill as it stands right now.”  President Donald Trump, also a Republican, had set a goal of signing a sweeping tax overhaul into law before the end of 2017. About a half-dozen lawmakers have voiced concerns about provisions including a nearly $1.5 trillion addition to the federal deficit, the treatment of small businesses and the potential impact on health insurances costs for people with medical conditions.  Senate Republicans hope to pass their bill as early as Thursday. With only a 52-48 majority in the 100-seat Senate, and Democrats unlikely to vote for the measure, they can lose support from no more than two members of their own ranks.   With the clock ticking, Trump was set to meet top Senate Republican tax writers at the White House as the administration considered policy tweaks to make the bill more palatable to potential Republican holdouts.

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A battle over who should run the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in the coming months was set for court as Obama-era holdovers sought to maintain their control over a powerful watchdog which President Donald Trump is seeking to curb. CFPB staff returning to work on Monday after the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday break were left scratching their heads over who was in charge after outgoing director Richard Cordray formally resigned on Friday and elevated his former chief of staff, Leandra English, to replace him temporarily. Hours later, President Donald Trump sought to over-rule that move by naming his budget chief Mick Mulvaney — a harsh critic of the agency — as acting director. Trump wants Mulvaney to run the CFPB until he can get a permanent successor confirmed by the Senate, a process which could take months. In yet another twist late on Sunday, English sued the Trump administration seeking to block Mulvaney’s appointment. The move means a federal court will now decide which law applies when filling a temporary leadership vacancy at the relatively new agency. The unprecedented battle reflects competing visions of how to regulate the U.S. financial system. Created in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers from predatory lending, the CFPB is hated by Republicans who think it wields too much power and burdens banks and other lenders with unnecessary red tape. President Barack Obama appointed Cordray, a Democrat, as the CFPB’s first director and he developed a reputation for drafting aggressive rules curbing products such as payday loans while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like Wells Fargo (WFC.N).  In a tweet over the weekend, Trump called the agency a “total disaster” that had “devastated” financial institutions. He has pledged to roll back many of the Obama-era financial regulations. Liberal groups and consumer advocates planned a rally in front of the CFPB headquarters on Monday morning to demonstrate support for the agency. As acting director, Mulvaney would have the power to make far-reaching decisions on enforcement and supervision of financial firms. Trump administration officials say the president has the power to appoint an acting director under the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act and, in an powerful boost for them, the CFPB’s own general counsel, Mary McLeod, issued a three-page memo agreeing.  “I advise all Bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that Director Mulvaney is the Acting Director of the CFPB,” McLeod’s memo, dated November 25, stated. Such advice will stick in the throats of many CFPB staffers. Mulvaney once described the agency as a “sad, sick joke” and tried to get rid of it when he was a lawmaker in the House of Representatives. English alluded to Mulvaney’s views on the CFPB in her lawsuit. She has argued that the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB  stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs. Cordray named English as deputy director and said she would become the acting director. The CFPB was the brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, a Democratic senator and liberal firebrand. Over the weekend, lawmakers from both parties lined up to give opposing views of its role. Dick Durbin, the U.S. Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, told CNN on Sunday that “Wall Street hates it like the devil hates holy water.” While the legal battle rages, the CFPB’s enforcement work will be put in limbo. “Anything that the agency does or fails to do could be subject to challenge until this cloud is removed,” said Harvard Law School professor Laurence Tribe. The CFPB was preparing to sue Santander (SAN.MC) as early as this week alleging that the Spanish bank overcharged borrowers on auto loans, two sources familiar with the plans told Reuters last week. It was not clear if that lawsuit will now go ahead. The agency’s rule-making ability has already been halted by the Republican-controlled Congress, which last month killed a CFPB rule that had allowed borrowers to join together to sue lenders. Even if English prevails, Trump’s permanent nominee is expected to neutralize much of the CFPB’s work. Some of the names mentioned by lobbyists as potential permanent successors to Cordray include Republican Representatives Jeb Hensarling and French Hill, both CFPB critics.

0,True,"November 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been thrown into disarray by a battle between the White House and Obama-era officials over who gets to run the federal watchdog on an interim basis after its director resigned.  Outgoing director Richard Cordray elevated an agency official to replace him on an interim basis. But Republican President Donald Trump then named his budget chief, Mick Mulvaney, as acting director until the president names a permanent successor who is confirmed by the Senate, which could take months. Here are some facts about the CFPB. The CFPB’s creation The CFPB was created in 2011 under Democratic former President Barack Obama in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis to look out for the interests of ordinary borrowers. Prior to the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act, which created the CFPB, consumer financial protection was spread across seven federal agencies. None of them prioritized the consumer, which critics said allowed predatory and deceptive mortgage practices to flourish, fueling the crisis. The agency’s duties The CFPB is the only federal agency focused exclusively on enforcing consumer financial laws. It is meant to ensure that all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services and that such markets are fair, transparent and competitive. It was given the power to issue regulations and monitor a range of lenders from banks to non-bank firms that were previously unsupervised at the federal level including mortgage companies and payday lenders. It also has the power to discipline firms for misconduct. Since opening its doors, it has levied fines and dealt with more than a million consumer complaints relating to mortgages, credit cards, student loans, debt collection and other financial products.  The CFPB said it has provided $11.7 billion in relief for more than 27 million harmed customers. That figure includes debts that were canceled or reduced as well as compensation paid out by firms. Controversy over the agency The brainchild of Elizabeth Warren, now a leading liberal voice in the U.S. Senate, the agency draws strong support from Democrats and strong opposition from Republicans, who say it wields too much unchecked power. Republicans objected to a clause in the Dodd Frank law that the CFPB director could be fired only “for cause” and they foiled Obama’s first choice for CFPB director, Warren, who at the time was a Harvard professor. Obama then appointed Richard Cordray as director while Congress was in recess. Republicans have introduced legislation to put a commission in charge of the CFPB to weaken the power of its single director and have Congress decide its funding. Currently, the U.S. Federal Reserve funds the agency. A federal appeals court ruled in 2016 that the structure of the CFPB was unconstitutional because it gave too much power to its director. Other agency heads who answer to the president can be fired at will. The CFPB has appealed that ruling, which came after it was sued by mortgage servicer PHH Corp.(PHH.N) Wall Street accuses the agency of imposing overly burdensome regulations and large fines. The agency during the Trump administration The Republican-led Congress and White House have put a halt to rule-making by the CFPB. The Trump administration is focused on rolling back Obama-era financial rules. Trump this month signed a congressional resolution that lets banks, credit card companies and other financial firms block customers from filing class action lawsuits. The move killed a CFPB rule released in July. CFPB restrictions on payday lenders, also known as “small-dollar” lending, are seen as the potential next target for Republicans. The CFPB’s power now is concentrated on enforcement, but that power may also be blunted. ",Factbox: What is the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau?
0,True,"November 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau official filed suit late on Sunday trying to prevent President Donald Trump from naming an acting head of the watchdog agency, but its top lawyer concluded Trump had the power to do so. The moves were the latest dramatic developments in the fight over leadership succession of an agency created in 2011 under Democratic former President Barack Obama to protect consumers from predatory lending practices. Republicans in the White House and Congress have tried to weaken the agency. The leadership of the agency was plunged into confusion on Friday after its outgoing Obama-era director Richard Cordray formally resigned and elevated his former chief of staff, Leandra English, to replace him on an interim basis until the Senate confirms a permanent successor named by Trump. Hours later, the Republican president named Mulvaney — his budget chief and a harsh critic of the agency — as its acting director. CFPB General Counsel Mary McLeod wrote a memo, first reported by Reuters, concurring with the opinion of the U.S. Justice Department that Trump had the power to appoint Mulvaney to the post. “I advise all Bureau personnel to act consistently with the understanding that Director Mulvaney is the Acting Director of the CFPB,” McLeod’s memo stated. Late on Sunday, English sued in U.S. District Court in Washington, seeking a temporary restraining order blocking Trump from appointing Mulvaney. In the filing, English said Mulvaney had no experience in a consumer protection or financial regulatory role, had sought to get rid of the agency and once described it as a “sad, sick joke.” McLeod’s intervention bolstered Trump’s position and isolated English, 34, who has held multiple jobs at the CFPB since its creation. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Trump administration is aware of English’s lawsuit, but said “the law is clear” and that Mulvaney is the acting director. Sanders pointed to McLeod’s conclusion, adding that “there should be no question” that Mulvaney can take the job. “It is unfortunate that Mr. Cordray decided to put his political ambition above the interests of consumers with this stunt. Director Mulvaney will bring a more serious and professional approach to running the CFPB,” Sanders said. Both sides in the battle say they have the law on their side. Democrats have said the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the agency stipulated that its deputy director would take over on an interim basis when a director departs until the Senate confirms a permanent director. Cordray named English as deputy director and said she would become the acting director. “It’s a very important fact ... their own general counsel came out with a different conclusion,” said Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP said. “Now that the thing is in court, I think it is really going to be in the hands of the judge.” Trump administration officials said the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives a president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards, an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB. “The president’s attempt to install a White House official at the head of independent agency — while allowing that official to simultaneously serve in the White House — is unprecedented,” said English’s lawyer, Deepak Gupta of the law firm Gupta Wessler, adding that “the law is clear” and that English is the acting director. Created after the 2008 financial crisis, the CFPB has issued rules and imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies.

Conyers said that while he denied the allegations, his presence during a congressional ethics review of the matter was a distraction. “I cannot in good conscience allow these charges to undermine my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus, and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee,” Conyers said.  Conyers, 88, from Michigan, is the longest-serving House lawmaker and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. The House Ethics Committee said last week it was investigating allegations of sexual harassment against Conyers, who said his office had resolved a harassment case with a payment but no admission of guilt. The allegations against Conyers came to light as Congress reviews policies on how to handle sexual harassment complaints. They followed a string of such complaints against prominent figures in the U.S. media, Hollywood and politics.  “In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me and continue to do so,” said Conyers. Twelve women who said they previously worked for Conyers told reporters in a statement on Sunday that he “was a gentleman and never behaved in a sexually inappropriate manner in our presence.” The group said it supported letting the ethics probe run its course. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi called for “zero tolerance” on sexual harassment in a statement released after Conyers’ email. “We are at a watershed moment on this issue, and no matter how great an individual’s legacy, it is not a license for harassment.”   ",Rep.

0,True,"November 25, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A battle between the White House and Democrats over warring appointments to head up the top U.S. regulator for consumer finance is likely headed for the courts, opening any interim actions by the agency to legal challenges, lawyers said on Saturday. Richard Cordray, a Democrat, stepped down on Friday as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which was created after the financial crisis to protect consumers from abusive lending practices, and he named staffer Leandra English as acting director. A few hours later, President Donald Trump named someone else to lead the agency: Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director and one of the CFPB’s fiercest critics.  The CFPB, the brainchild of Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat and a liberal firebrand, has long been in the crosshairs of Republicans, who say it has had too much unchecked power. On Saturday, Trump tweeted that the CFPB - which has imposed steep penalties on banks, auto dealers, student lenders and credit card companies for predatory lending practices - had “devastated” financial institutions.  Democrats and Republicans agree that Trump may nominate a permanent CFPB chief, but they disagree over who may lead the agency in the interim, a dispute which could drag on for months until the Senate confirms a permanent Trump appointment. The dispute is over which federal law prevails in naming an interim director. According to Democrats, the relevant law is the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law that created the CFPB, which stipulates that the agency’s deputy director is to take over in the short term.  Cordray, in announcing his resignation on Friday, said he had named English as deputy director and that she would become the acting director. But administration officials say the 1998 Federal Vacancies Reform Act gives the president the power to temporarily fill agency positions, except for those with multi-member boards - an exemption they said did not apply to the CFPB. On Saturday evening, the Justice Department said in a memo that the White House was right to name a new CFPB director. The Dodd-Frank language about changing CFPB directors is “unusual” but the White House may name an interim chief, according to the memo. Such advice from the Justice Department is open to legal challenge. Alan Kaplinsky, head of the Consumer Financial Services Group for law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, said the issue will likely have to be decided in the courts. In the meantime, he said, “This enormous cloud of uncertainty” will hang over the CFPB. Kaplinsky said he believes that Dodd-Frank provides for the deputy director to take charge during the short-term, but Congress did not explicitly list the resignation of the director as a situation where the deputy would step up. “I think Trump wins, but unfortunately it is going to take a while,” Kaplinsky said. Quyen Truong, a partner at law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who was the assistant director and deputy general counsel for the CFPB until early 2016, said the industry should expect CFPB staff to continue their work, but that the “agency’s actions during this period almost certainly will be subject to legal challenge.” Despite the legal uncertainty, Mulvaney is expected to “show up Monday and he will go into the office and start working,” a senior administration official said on Saturday. White House officials said English was also expected to turn up on Monday and serve as Mulvaney’s deputy. English could not be reached for comment.  Cordray is the only person to have led the young agency, making this the first time that succession of the director has been tested. Administration officials said the appointment of Mulvaney was “routine” and that the White House had sought guidance from the Justice Department before Friday’s announcement.  “This needs to be decided in the courts,” Warren said in a tweet on Saturday.  Industry critics said the succession battle underlined that the agency lacks proper Congressional oversight.  “The CFPB’s current governing structure is a dictatorship, period,” Richard Hunt, head of the Consumer Bankers Association, a trade group for retail banking, said in a statement. Democrats and consumer advocates said it was unfair and inappropriate to put Mulvaney - who once described the CFPB as a “joke” - in charge. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives’ Financial Services Committee, said Mulvaney would have too much power, as the CFPB director also sits on the boards of two other financial regulatory agencies. “The White House would have an alarming degree of direct control over financial regulation, supervision, and enforcement,” Waters said in a statement.

0,True,"November 23, 2017 ",politicsNews,"PALM BEACH, FLORIDA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump gave a bullish Thanksgiving address to troops overseas on Thursday, hailing progress in Afghanistan and against ISIS, and telling them they were fighting for “something real,” including a stock market at record highs and his promised “big, beautiful fat tax cuts.” Speaking in a live video teleconference from Palm Beach, Florida, with military personnel serving in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, Trump told them they were “very, very special people.” He called troops in Afghanistan “brave, incredible fighters” who had “turned it around” in the past three to four months. “We opened it up; we said go ahead, we’re going to fight to win,” he said. “We’re not fighting any more to just walk around, we are fighting to win.” Trump said the Marines were inflicting “defeat after defeat” on Islamic State, and again credited his change of approach compared to that of the Obama administration. “They weren’t letting you win before; they were letting you break even. ... They weren’t letting you win,” he said. Trump told the troops they could look forward at home to the benefits of “big, beautiful fat tax cuts,” a stock market at record highs, jobs and economic growth. “We’re doing well at home, the economy is doing great,” Trump said. “You’re fighting for something real, you’re fighting for something good.” Trump took one of his trademark swipes at the news media as he spoke from a lavishly decorated room at his Mar-a-Lago resort, telling the military personnel he was addressing that journalists were in the room, and adding: “Better me than you; believe me fellas, better me than you.” Later, Trump and his wife, Melania, handed out sandwiches and shook hands at a Coast Guard station in nearby Riviera Beach and told personnel his administration was building up wealth so it could protect the country through military acquisitions. Talking about his plans for boosting military spending, he said contractors saved the best equipment for U.S. troops. “When we sell to other countries - you never know about an ally - an ally can turn,” he said. Trump said he had told the troops overseas the country was “doing great,” thanks to his cuts in “regulation and all the waste and all the abuse.”  “I told them ... you folks are fighting so hard and working so hard, and it’s nice that you’re working for something that’s really starting to work.” While optimism about a major tax overhaul has helped push the U.S. stock market up for most of this year, Trump is still seeking his first major legislative win after almost a year in office. According to a majority of economists in a recent Reuters poll, U.S. Republicans are not expected to push the tax cuts through Congress this year. Economists are also skeptical that the legislation would provide a significant boost to the economy. ","In Thanksgiving message, Trump hails military gains and 'big, beautiful, fat tax cuts'"
0,True,"November 24, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the White House said on Friday. The action came hours after Richard Cordray submitted his formal resignation and named a deputy director as his replacement, setting the stage for a political and legal battle over the regulator’s leadership. “The president looks forward to seeing Director Mulvaney take a common sense approach to leading the CFPB’s dedicated staff, an approach that will empower consumers to make their own financial decisions and facilitate investment in our communities,” the White House said in its statement. Democratic lawmakers are eager to preserve the regulator for as long as possible while Republicans want to put in place new leadership to chart a drastically different course.  The six-year-old bureau has policed consumer financial markets, drafting aggressive rules curbing products like payday loans, while issuing multimillion dollar fines against large financial institutions like Wells Fargo. But Republicans have consistently complained the agency is too powerful and lacks oversight from Congress on its operations, and they are eager to take control. Mulvaney, who has criticized the bureau in the past, said, “I look forward to working with the expert personnel within the agency to identify how the bureau can transition to be more effective in its mission, while becoming more accountable to the taxpayer.” The succession plan has never been tested, with Cordray as its first and only full-time director. Cordray had previously announced plans to resign by the end of November. In a statement to staff, he said that Leandra English, the CFPB’s chief of staff, had been named deputy director and would take over as acting director of the agency upon his exit. However, the White House had already said it planned to name its own interim leadership at the regulator. Trump has pushed to ease regulations on businesses, including the financial sector, a stance seemingly at odds with Cordray’s more aggressive regulatory approach. Earlier this month, White House deputy press secretary Raj Shah said that the administration “will announce an acting director and the president’s choice to replace Mr Cordray at the appropriate time.” There are competing theories in Washington as to who can name Cordray’s replacement. Democrats point to language in the Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB, stipulating the deputy director replaces the director when he or she leaves. But others say a separate law governing federal vacancies gives Trump power to name someone elsewhere in the administration to that role temporarily, while the White House identifies a full-time nominee who would be confirmed by the Senate.

0,True,"November 24, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for former national security adviser Michael Flynn have halted communications with U.S. President Donald Trump’s legal team, a potentially critical step in the probe into contacts between Trump’s election campaign and Russia, sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday. Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, called John Dowd, Trump’s private lawyer, on Wednesday to say the matter had reached a point where the two could no longer could discuss it, two people familiar with the call told Reuters on Friday. The New York Times first reported that the two sets of lawyers had stopped communicating.  Flynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with alleged Russian efforts to boost his 2016 presidential campaign. It was not clear whether Kelner made the call because he had negotiated a plea agreement with Mueller for Flynn to cooperate in the probe, or because Flynn had decided to engage with Mueller, said two other sources. “No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president,” Jay Sekulow, another attorney for Trump, said on Thursday.     Dowd on Friday declined to comment on the matter, as did Peter Carr, Mueller’s spokesman. Kelner also declined to comment. White House officials also have declined to comment. The cooperation of Flynn, who was a top campaign adviser before becoming Trump’s national security adviser in the White House, would be a major asset in Mueller’s investigation. In March, as he unsuccessfully sought immunity for his client to testify to House and Senate investigations into the issue, Kelner said, “Mr. Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he certainly wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit.”  Two sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said Flynn may be able to provide insight into three major areas of inquiry. These are: any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 campaign; money laundering and other possible financial crimes by Trump aides; and whether Trump sought to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey in May, as Comey was probing the Trump campaign’s dealings with Russia. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Trump has repeatedly denied any collusion with Russia by his campaign and has called the inquiry a witch hunt. Two congressional officials involved in separate probes into the Trump campaign’s contacts with Russia said one key area of investigation is whether Flynn or other advisers to Trump ever suggested U.S. economic sanctions on Russia could be lifted in exchange for favorable business deals. Possible deals include a proposed commercial nuclear power project involving Russian firms that Flynn in recent years worked to promote to potential clients in the Middle East, sources familiar with the project told Reuters. “At this point, there is no evidence of an effort to negotiate that kind of deal, but Flynn is near the top of the list of people who probably would know if there was any such effort,” said one of the congressional officials, also speaking on the condition of anonymity. Trump fired Flynn on Feb. 13, after disclosures that Flynn had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with then Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in December, the month before Trump took office, and later misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Flynn has acknowledged contacts with Kislyak dating back to 2013, but beyond saying they covered a variety of subjects has said nothing about the content of their conversations during Trump’s campaign and after his election. Flynn has been under scrutiny by the special counsel in a number of areas, sources familiar with the investigation have said. Mueller has been investigating whether Flynn knowingly made false statements to the government about his foreign travels, income, and contacts on his security clearance form. Flynn also has come under scrutiny for work on behalf of Russian clients, and over whether his work for a businessman with ties to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was lawful.  Mueller has been investigating Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn, Jr.’s, involvement in some of his father’s business dealings in Russia, Turkey, and elsewhere, the sources said, and that could provide a potent additional incentive for Flynn to cooperate. Barry Coburn, a lawyer for Flynn’s son, declined to comment. ","Flynn could prove to be key asset in Mueller's U.S. campaign probe, sources say"

0,True,"November 23, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for Michael Flynn, President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, have told Trump’s legal team they can no longer discuss a probe into Russian meddling in the U.S. election, indicating Flynn may be cooperating with the investigation, the New York Times reported on Thursday. Flynn, a retired Army general, is a central figure in a federal investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into whether Trump aides colluded with Russia to boost his 2016 presidential campaign. The probe has hung over the White House since January, when U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her. Russia has denied interfering in the U.S. election and Trump has said there was no collusion. Flynn’s lawyer and a spokesman for Mueller declined to comment on Thursday. Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Trump, said: “No one should draw the conclusion that this means anything about General Flynn cooperating against the president.” The Times reported that Flynn’s lawyers had been sharing information with Trump’s legal team about the Mueller investigation. Citing four unnamed people involved in the case, the newspaper reported the cooperation agreement had ended. Due to rules that aim to prevent conflicts of interest when lawyers represent clients, the move by Flynn’s lawyers to stop communicating with Trump’s lawyers indicated Flynn was now cooperating with Mueller, the Times said, although adding that in itself was not proof. But the development has led Trump’s lawyers to believe that Flynn has begun discussions with Mueller about cooperating, according to the Times. Flynn served 24 days as Trump’s national security adviser but was fired after it was discovered he had misrepresented his contacts with a Russian diplomat to Vice President Mike Pence. Mueller’s inquiry is looking into Flynn’s paid work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman in 2016, in addition to contacts between Russian officials and Flynn and other Trump associates during and after the Nov. 8 presidential election, Reuters reported in June. A lawyer for Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., who worked with his father and is also being investigated by Mueller, according to a person familiar with the matter, declined to comment.

0,True,"November 23, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Wednesday ordered a review of a government database used for background checks on gun buyers, after a man who killed 26 people in a Texas church was left off the system despite having a criminal record. Sessions said the Nov. 5 shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, by Devin Kelley, a former Air Force serviceman who had a 2012 conviction for domestic assault, showed that not all the necessary information was being added to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS. In a statement, Sessions said he was directing the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives “to do a comprehensive review of the NICS and report back to me the steps we can take to ensure that those who are prohibited from purchasing firearms are prevented from doing so.” Kelley was found guilty by an Air Force court-martial in 2012 of assaulting his first wife and a stepson. Federal law prohibits anyone from selling a gun to someone who has been convicted of a crime involving domestic violence against a spouse or child. The Air Force has said it failed to provide information as required about Kelley’s criminal history to the FBI’s criminal database. Sessions said he was directing the FBI and ATF to determine if the Defense Department and other government agencies were properly reporting information to the database. Kelley, who killed himself during a getaway attempt after the shooting, bought guns from a store in Texas in 2016 and 2017, although it is not clear whether those were the weapons used in the massacre. The U.S. House of Representatives Armed Services Committee said earlier this month it would investigate the Air Force’s failure to notify the FBI of Kelley’s criminal record. U.S. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, said he planned to introduce legislation to ensure that federal agencies put required criminal records into the database.

Asked at a luncheon hosted by The Economic Club of Chicago how many years Republican President Donald Trump will be in office, Dimon said, “If I had to bet, I’d bet three and half. But the Democrats have to come up with a reasonable candidate ... or Trump will win again.” Dimon, who in the past has described himself as “barely” a Democrat, has been going to Washington more often since the 2016 elections to lobby lawmakers on issues including changes in corporate taxes, immigration policies and mortgage finance. In December, Dimon became chairman of the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs who take their views to government policymakers. Dimon, 61, touched on wide range of topics, from America’s political climate to racial discrimination to the effects of the U.K. leaving the European Union. He also commented on foreign affairs, saying, for example, “We should never be rude to a neighbor like Mexico” and cautioning that the political weakness of German Chancellor Angela Merkel “is bad for all of us.” Talks on forming a governing coalition including Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union collapsed earlier this week, casting doubt on her future after 12 years in power. Dimon spoke for several minutes about discrimination over gender and race which he said is not acknowledged enough in the United States. “If you’re white, paint yourself black and walk down the street one day, and you’ll probably have a little more empathy for how some of these folks get treated,” Dimon said. “We need to make a special effort because this is a special problem.” Dimon gave his own bank a mixed review on diversity.

0,True,"November 22, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The communications director for U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore has resigned amid the Alabama Republican’s efforts to combat allegations of sexual misconduct that have roiled his campaign. News of the departure of John Rogers came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump defended Moore from accusations by multiple women that Moore pursued them as teenagers when he was in his 30s, including one who has said he initiated a sexual encounter with her when she was 14. Moore has denied any wrongdoing and has accused the women of conspiring with Democrats, media outlets and establishment Republicans in an effort to tarnish his reputation. Reuters has not independently confirmed any of the accusations. “As we all know, campaigns make changes throughout the duration of the campaign,” campaign Chairman Bill Armistead said in a statement on Wednesday. “John made the decision to leave the campaign last Friday - any representations to the contrary are false - and we wish him well.” Fox News journalist Dan Gallo said on Twitter that Brett Doster, a Moore campaign adviser, told him: “Unfortunately John just did not have the experience to deal with the press the last couple of weeks, and we’ve had to make a change.” Doster did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Moore, 70, a conservative Christian and former Alabama chief justice, won the nomination for the Dec. 12 special election in a hotly contested primary against incumbent Senator Luther Strange. Strange, who was appointed to fill the Senate vacancy left by Jeff Sessions, now U.S. attorney general, was backed by Republican leaders, including the president, while Moore’s campaign attracted support from insurgent right-wing figures like former Trump strategist Steve Bannon. Trump told reporters on Tuesday, however, that he might yet campaign for Moore, who he said “totally denies” the misconduct allegations, and that Democratic nominee Doug Jones was a liberal who should not be elected. The president’s stance stood in contrast to the reactions from most Republicans in Washington, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who have called on Moore to step aside. Jones released a campaign advertisement on Wednesday featuring the nine women who have accused Moore of improper conduct. “They were girls when Roy Moore immorally pursued them,” the narrator says, as photos of the women as young girls flash on the screen. “Will we make their abuser a U.S. senator?” ",U.S. Senate candidate Moore's spokesman resigns as allegations roil campaign

0,True,"November 22, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday called the Myanmar military operation against the Rohingya population “ethnic cleansing” and  threatened targeted sanctions against those responsible for what it called “horrendous atrocities.” “The situation in northern Rakhine state constitutes ethnic cleansing against the Rohingya,” U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement, using a term he avoided when visiting Myanmar, also known as Burma, last week. “The United States will also pursue accountability through U.S. law, including possible targeted sanctions” against those responsible for the alleged abuses, which have driven hundreds of thousands of Rohingya into neighboring Bangladesh, he said. The United States shifted its stance in part to raise pressure on Myanmar’s military and civilian leaders, who have shared power for the past two years under an uneasy arrangement after decades of military rule, to address the crisis. Rights monitors accused Myanmar’s military of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations after Rohingya militants’ Aug. 25 attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, mostly to neighboring Bangladesh, since the crackdown, which followed the insurgent attacks.     “These abuses by some among the Burmese military, security forces, and local vigilantes have caused tremendous suffering and forced hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children to flee their homes,” Tillerson said. While repeating U.S. condemnation of the insurgent attacks, he added: “No provocation can justify the horrendous atrocities that have ensued.” Myanmar’s 2-year-old government, led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals with whom it shares power. “It’s not a situation that is completely under her authority, but certainly we are counting on her to show leadership and also to work through the civilian government with the military to address the crisis,” a senior U.S. official told reporters in a conference call. The term “ethnic cleansing” is not defined in international or U.S. law and does not inherently carry specific consequences, a second senior U.S. official said on the call. Murray Hiebert, a Southeast Asia analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank in Washington, said the State Department’s use of the term and threat of sanctions “will likely have limited to no impact on the ground.” “It is likely to create more distrust between the United States and Myanmar’s military and government and push them closer to China, Russia, and its more authoritarian neighbors in Southeast Asia,” he added.  The U.S. move came the same day as a U.N. tribunal convicted former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity for massacres of Bosnian Muslims and ethnic cleansing campaigns, and imprisoned him for life. The second U.S. official said Washington was analyzing whether genocide or crimes against humanity had occurred in Myanmar, which would violate international law, but has made no determination on either and that this would take time to assess. “In the end it’s a court that has to decide that, as we’ve just seen with the verdict against Mladic,” he said. A top U.N. official in September described the military actions as a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing,” but the United States until Wednesday had avoided the term.  Washington has sought to balance its wish to nurture the civilian government in Myanmar, where it competes for influence with China, with its desire to hold the military accountable for the abuses. U.S. officials also worry that the mistreatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority may fuel radicalism. The first U.S. official said Washington would work with Bangladesh and Myanmar to encourage the voluntary repatriation of Rohingya. “We have focused on the issue of voluntary returns,” the official said. “We don’t want people to be forced to return to a situation in which they feel uncomfortable.”  Congressional pressure for a tougher U.S. response to the Rohingya crisis mounted before President Donald Trump’s first visit to Asia this month to attend a summit of Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, in Manila. U.S. government sources told Reuters in October that officials were preparing a recommendation for Tillerson that would define the military-led campaign against the Rohingya as ethnic cleansing, which could spur new sanctions. In early November, U.S. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on Myanmar military officials. Rights group Amnesty International called for a comprehensive arms embargo against Myanmar as well as targeted financial sanctions against senior Myanmar military officials.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump defended embattled U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore on Tuesday, saying the Alabama Republican had denied allegations of sexual misconduct and emphasizing that he did not want Moore’s Democratic opponent to win. Trump previously said that Moore should step aside if the allegations were true. Speaking to reporters at the White House before leaving Washington for Florida, Trump left open the possibility of campaigning for Moore, saying he would make an announcement on that next week. The president also ripped into Moore’s opponent, Democrat Doug Jones, describing the former prosecutor as liberal and soft on crime. The comments represented a shift in strategy for the White House, which previously tried to keep its distance from the controversy sparked by a Washington Post report detailing accusations by four women that Moore pursued them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. More women have since spoken out with allegations of their own. “He totally denies it. He says it didn’t happen. And, you know, you have to listen to him also,” Trump said. Trump’s position was a break from that of other national Republicans. U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other prominent lawmakers have pressed Moore to quit the race. It also contrasted with comments from his daughter Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser who told the Associated Press there was a “special place in hell for people who prey on children.” She said she had no reason to doubt the women’s accounts. Moore, 70, has denied any wrongdoing. The married Christian conservative has said he is the victim of a witch hunt and has declined to drop out of the race. Reuters has not been able to confirm any of the accusations independently. During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump himself faced accusations from several women that he had in the past made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate personal remarks about them. Trump denied the allegations, accusing Democrats and the media of a smear campaign. Trump supported Moore’s opponent, Senator Luther Strange, in the Republican primary race for the open U.S. Senate seat vacated by now-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, but he backed Moore after the former Alabama chief justice won the nomination. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. They are eager to hold on to that advantage to pass Trump’s legislative agenda on taxes, healthcare and other priorities. Since the accusations against Moore were reported, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders has said repeatedly that Alabama voters should decide the election and called the allegations  “troubling.”  The White House also backed the Republican National Committee’s decision to withdraw support for Moore. But the administration’s position appeared to start evolving this week when White House counselor Kellyanne Conway criticized Jones during an interview with Fox News and said the White House wanted a Republican to win the seat in order to support Trump’s plan for a tax overhaul. Trump, who had declined until Tuesday to answer questions about the Alabama race, was prepared with a list of complaints about Jones when facing reporters on the south lawn of the White House. “I can tell you one thing for sure: We don’t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat, Jones,” Trump said. “I’ve looked at his record. It’s terrible on crime. It’s terrible on the border. It’s terrible on the military. I can tell you for a fact, we do not need somebody that’s going to be bad on crime, bad on borders, bad with the military, bad for the Second Amendment.” Before the allegations came to light, Moore was heavily favored to defeat Jones, a former federal prosecutor, in the special election on Dec. 12. Two opinion polls last week showed Moore now trailing Jones. “Doug believes the women, and that the people of Alabama will hold Roy Moore accountable,” Jones’ spokesman, Sebastian Kitchen, said in a statement. Among those prosecuted by Jones when he was a U.S. attorney in Alabama were two former Ku Klux Klan members for their involvement in a 1963 church bombing in Birmingham that killed four girls.

There was an increase, however, in the number of new consumers to the program created by former President Barack Obama, to 220,323 from 208,397 in the previous week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said.  Republican President Donald Trump and lawmakers are trying to undo Obama’s health law but do not have enough votes to repeal it and so must continue to run the insurance program, which offers income-based subsidies. Uncertainty over its future drove 2018 monthly premiums up more than 30 percent on average as insurers such as Anthem Inc, Centene Corp and Molina Healthcare sought to cover higher costs. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 11 million will enroll in 2018, up from 2017’s 10 million, even as the period for sign-ups has been cut in half to six weeks and will end on Dec. 15. Total sign-ups for Obamacare individual insurance in the 39 states that use HealthCare.gov reached 2.28 million during the first three weeks of enrollment. The figures do not include enrollment in Washington, D.C. or the 11 states including New York and California that run their own enrollment and websites.  Among the states using HealthCare.gov with the highest number of individuals signing up were Florida, 498,168; Texas, 271,737; North Carolina, 138,932; Georgia, 119,968; and Pennsylvania, 101,286, the agency said.

Beto O’Rourke’s long-shot bid to unseat incumbent Republican Senator Ted Cruz illustrates the tightrope Democrats must walk as they gear up for the November 2018 elections. Democrats will have to win in areas that backed Trump last year in order to gain control of the House of Representatives and the Senate but even in Texas the party’s left-wing base is pressing candidates to stop the president by any means necessary. O’Rourke, who currently represents El Paso in the House, is drawing big crowds across Texas as he calls for universal healthcare and new restrictions on gun ownership. At a recent rally outside Houston, hundreds of supporters stood in line for up to an hour to shake his hand. O’Rourke, 45, said Trump’s surprise victory last year was a big reason he decided to run for the Senate. He said Trump’s racially charged rhetoric and divisive governing style have led him to support impeachment. “I’m now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that Donald Trump is unfit for that office,” O’Rourke told Reuters in an interview. “This is a moment unlike any other, certainly in my lifetime, I think in this country since the Civil War, where we have to really decide who we are, and there are two very clear paths that we can take,” he said. The end of the path laid out by Trump “is tyranny, it is not democracy,” O’Rourke said. O’Rourke’s unapologetic progressivism stands out among Democrats who are campaigning outside the party’s liberal strongholds in the Northeast and on West Coast. In deeply conservative Alabama, Democratic Senate candidate Doug Jones has been running as a pragmatist ahead of a Dec. 12 special election, saying he wants to be a “voice for reason” in Washington. He has run ads attacking Republican opponent Roy Moore over a sex scandal, but has steered clear of harsh anti-Trump rhetoric.  In Virginia, Ralph Northam denounced Trump as a “narcissistic maniac” as he sought the Democratic nomination for governor, but dialed back the rhetoric during the general election, telling voters ahead of his Nov. 7 victory that he would work with Trump when it was in his state’s interest. In Congress, a handful of rank-and-file House Democrats have filed articles of impeachment even though U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is still investigating whether Trump’s campaign worked with Russia in last year’s election. Russia has repeatedly denied meddling and Trump has called the investigation a “witch hunt.” Democratic House Leader Nancy Pelosi said earlier this month that she would not make impeachment a priority if her party won the House next year but Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer has said it is premature to consider impeachment. Even some of O’Rourke’s supporters say impeachment talk is counterproductive as long as Republicans control Congress. “Otherwise, in my view, it’s just chest-beating,” said Nikki Redpath, a Houston-area homemaker and O’Rourke campaign volunteer. O’Rourke is seen as the favorite to win the Democratic nomination in March but analysts say his progressive views could prove a liability as he tries to reverse his party’s long losing streak in the Lone Star State. Trump finished nine percentage points ahead of Democrat Hillary Clinton in Texas last year and the state has not elected a Democratic governor or senator since 1994. Democrats have lost recent statewide elections by double-digit margins and have struggled to recruit top-tier candidates for major races. Still, O’Rourke’s anti-Trump message has resonated with oil-industry executive Katherine Stovring, who said she used to vote for candidates from both parties but now has been motivated to work for Democratic candidates as a way to stop Trump.  “I’m looking for ways to engage. This is our democracy at risk,” she said. Texas Republican strategist Matt Mackowiak said he thought O’Rourke would be trounced by Cruz unless voters turn en masse against Trump nationally. “He’s a more interesting candidate than the traditional sacrificial lamb the Democrats put up,” Mackowiak said. “But he’s far too liberal to be elected statewide.” In an era where differences between Republicans and Democrats are stark, candidates like O’Rourke have little incentive to moderate their positions, said James Henson, director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas. At this point there is little downside for O’Rourke to make polarizing statements on impeachment and other issues.     “I think you can expect to hear a lot more of that as the campaign unfolds,” he said.

0,True,"November 22, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday reignited a feud with the father of one of the three UCLA basketball players who were detained in China on suspicion of shoplifting, calling him an “ungrateful fool” in a series of early-morning tweets.   LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo Ball, has played down Trump’s involvement in the three athletes’ release from Chinese detention after they admitted to stealing items from three stores during a team trip to China earlier this month. “...LaVar, you could have spent the next 5 to 10 years during Thanksgiving with your son in China, but no NBA contract to support you. But remember LaVar, shoplifting is NOT a little thing. It’s a really big deal, especially in China. Ungrateful fool!,” Trump tweeted.   In another tweet, Trump took sole credit for getting LiAngelo Ball out of a long-term prison sentence - and not the White House, the State Department or LaVar Ball’s associates in China.  “IT WAS ME. Too bad! LaVar is just a poor man’s version of Don King, but without the hair. Just think.. ,” Trump tweeted, referring to the American boxing promoter. Ball has declined to thank the president and downplayed his role in helping to get his son home from China.  The three players have apologized and thanked Trump for helping secure their release by raising the issue with Chinese President Xi Jinping during a visit to the country earlier this month. All three players have been suspended indefinitely from the UCLA basketball team. On Sunday, Trump tweeted that he “should have left them in jail!” The Republican president also weighed in on another pet peeve: National Football League players kneeling during the national anthem at games. The Washington Post reported on Tuesday that league owners are considering reverting to an earlier practice of keeping players off the field during the national anthem. “The NFL is now thinking about a new idea - keeping teams in the Locker Room during the National Anthem next season. That’s almost as bad as kneeling!” Trump said in a third early-morning tweet. “When will the highly paid Commissioner finally get tough and smart? This issue is killing your league! ...” A NFL representative had no immediate comment. ",Trump: Father of UCLA player in shoplifting case is 'ungrateful fool'
0,True,"November 22, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The tax overhaul pushed by President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans is prompting a slew of attack ads by Democrats and progressive groups that say the legislation would lavish benefits on corporations and the rich, while harming the middle class. One ad launched on Tuesday warns that the Republican tax plan would leave Maine residents “lost in the wilderness” as it pans through a dark, deserted forest. The television spot, paid for by the group Not One Penny, urges the state’s Republican senator, Susan Collins, who is undecided on the plan and whose vote could help decide its fate in the Senate, “not to lose her way.” Another Not One Penny ad in Nevada, where Republican Senator Dean Heller faces a tough re-election race next year, says that the Senate plan is “a tax break for billionaires and wealthy corporations, paid for by higher taxes on every day Nevadans.” Republicans are looking to pass tax legislation within the next few weeks. Groups spending millions on the ads are aiming to sway public opinion in the final stretch of debate over the legislation, which would cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, and reduce individual income tax rates. Liberals see criticism of the tax plan as a potent issue for the 2018 U.S. congressional elections, when all 435 House seats are up for re-election, along with 33 in the Senate. The House of Representatives passed its tax bill last week. The Senate plans to vote once lawmakers return to Washington after this week’s U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. Republicans are under pressure to deliver a tax bill to score their first major legislative achievement since taking control of the White House and both chambers of Congress in January. Many Democratic ads focus on Republicans thought to be vulnerable in the 2018 elections. Others target Republicans such as Collins in the Senate, where Republicans have a slim 52-48 majority and can afford to lose just two Republican votes and still pass a tax bill, with Democrats united in opposition. Republicans say their tax plans would provide across-the-board cuts for both businesses and middle-class workers, along with tax code simplifications that would make it easier for individual taxpayers to file. Republican tax writers contend their plan would mean a “typical family of four would see their tax bill drop by nearly 60 percent.” But Democrats say Republicans have used as a model a family with a specific set of tax circumstances, and that other families at similar income levels could end up paying more.  Both the House and Senate plans cut individual tax rates but eliminate popular deductions. In the Senate plan, the tax rate cut for individuals is temporary, while the corporate rate cut is permanent. The Senate plan would repeal a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires individuals to pay a penalty if they do not have health insurance. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has estimated that the Senate bill would, beginning in 2021, lead to higher tax bills on average for households earning $10,000 to $30,000 annually. By 2027, most taxpayers earning $75,000 or less annually would be paying more taxes, the JCT said.  Democratic advocacy group Priorities USA on Tuesday increased to $2 million a tax-related digital ad campaign targeting voters in 20 House districts where Republicans voted for the House bill. It also plans ads in states represented by Senate Republicans Collins (Maine), Heller (Nevada), John McCain (Arizona), Bob Corker (Tennessee) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska). The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running digital ads in more than 40 Republican-held House districts. The group Save My Care is running digital ads in the districts of 14 House Republicans who voted for the bill, and in Alaska, Arizona and Maine. Republican and conservative groups are running ads of their own. The National Republican Congressional Committee started running spots in multiple districts last week promoting the tax bill. America First Policies, a nonprofit run by former Trump campaign advisers, is spending $135,000 this week for spots on conservative radio programs.

0,True,"November 22, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Haitian immigrants on Tuesday decried a U.S. decision to end a program that granted 59,000 Haitians temporary visas after the 2010 earthquake, saying they would be sent back to a country that has yet to recover from that disaster and others since. The United States offered Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, to Haitians after the January 2010 earthquake killed some 300,000 people and devastated a country that has long been the poorest in the Americas. The administration of former President Barack Obama  extended the program several times, finding that conditions in Haiti were too dire to send the beneficiaries home. President Donald Trump’s administration, after previously granting a six-month extension, announced on Monday that it would end TPS for Haiti in July 2019. Any Haitian who cannot obtain another kind of U.S. visa will be subject to deportation back to the Caribbean nation, where some earthquake victims are still homeless and the country is wobbling from Hurricane Matthew, a cholera outbreak and political instability.    “We’re just left in a void,” said Sebastian Joseph, 26, a Haitian immigrant living in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn   where Haitians and other Caribbeans are concentrated. He said virtually all Haitians want to stay in the United States, where they have carved out a niche in construction and healthcare services such as caring for the elderly and sick. “America has been the home of the free for 200 years or more. Everybody wants to come to America,” Joseph said. “A lot of people will go back to nothing.”    Trump’s supporters note that the visa program was always meant to be temporary and that Trump ran a 2016 presidential campaign promising restrictive immigration policies. At least one Haitian TPS recipient in Brooklyn accepted that eventually she must return. “If they say I have 18 months and that’s it, I say thank God, and then I will go,” said Margaret Etienne, who gave birth to a 3-year-old son here who is now a U.S. citizen. “It’s my country. I love my country,” she said after buying takeout from a Haitian restaurant with her son on a stretch of Church Avenue that is also called Bob Marley Boulevard, after the late Jamaican musician. In ending the TPS designation, acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke said she had determined that the “extraordinary but temporary conditions caused by the 2010 earthquake no longer exist.” Some critics dispute that Haiti has recovered and question how Duke reached such a conclusion. Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, the state with the most Haitians, urged Trump to extend TPS, warning in a column he wrote for the Miami Herald that “Haitians sent home will face dire conditions, including lack of housing, inadequate health services and low prospects for employment.” Fifty-nine percent of Haiti’s population lives below the poverty line of $2.41 per day, according to the World Bank. “It’s not going to be good for me. I don’t know what I would do,” said Ives Joseph Laforgue, 63, an unemployed Haitian immigrant in Flatbush who said he had open-heart surgery in 2014 and lives off the charity of Brooklyn’s Haitian community. Still, he said he would have even less in Haiti. Haitian community leaders and pro-immigration politicians in New York on Tuesday pledged to pressure the Trump administration to extend TPS. Among them was U.S. Representative Nydia Velazquez, a Democrat who introduced legislation that would protect from deportation immigrants who have TPS and Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), another program subject to presidential discretion that was extended by Obama but is due to expire in March 2018. Ricot Dupuy, station manager of Radio Soleil, a Haitian-themed broadcaster in New York, said he thinks the decision is racially motivated.  “This pressure to send immigrants back home ... The idea is to whiten America,” Dupuy said from his Brooklyn studio.  “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is not stupid. They know that TPS holders, it’s good for this country. The business community knows it’s good for them. And eventually they may have the last word.” ",Haitians in U.S. malign Trump decision to send them back home
0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.”  Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives Ethics Committee said on Tuesday it was investigating allegations of sexual harassment against U.S. Representative John Conyers, who said his office had resolved a harassment case with a payment but no admission of guilt. A BuzzFeed News report late on Monday cited allegations from former staffers that Conyers, 88, made sexual advances to female staff.  The Democratic congressman from Michigan issued a statement on Tuesday prior to the Ethics Committee’s announcement that did not give details of the case but said he would fully cooperate in any investigation. The allegations against Conyers came to light as Congress  reviews policies on how to handle sexual harassment complaints. They followed a string of such complaints against prominent figures in the U.S. media, Hollywood and politics. “In this case, I expressly and vehemently denied the allegations made against me and continue to do so,” said Conyers, who is one of America’s most prominent black lawmakers. “My office resolved the allegations – with an express denial of liability – in order to save all involved from the rigors of protracted litigation. That should not be lost in the narrative.”  The statement said the resolution of the allegations was equal to a reasonable severance payment. The Ethics Committee said in a statement it was aware of the public allegations and had begun an investigation. The panel can recommend punishments such as a reprimand, censure or expulsion, but the final punishment is determined by a vote in the full House. No member of Congress has ever been expelled for sexual misconduct. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi had called for the panel to open a probe of Conyers. “Any credible allegation of sexual harassment must be investigated by the Ethics Committee,” she said in a statement.  First elected in 1964, Conyers is the longest serving member of the House and a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. In a statement, the chairman of the caucus, Democratic Representative Cedric Richmond, called the allegations “very serious and disturbing” and urged Conyers to “cooperate fully with any and all investigations into this matter.” U.S. Representative Jackie Speier, a Democrat who has led the push in the House to revise policies on sexual harassment complaints, called for an investigation. “The allegations of sexual harassment and misuse of congressional funds against Congressman Conyers are serious & require an immediate Ethics investigation,” she said in a statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan issued a statement earlier calling the latest news report “extremely troubling.”  ",House ethics panel investigating allegations against U.S. Rep. Conyers
0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of about a dozen U.S. State Department officials have taken the unusual step of formally accusing Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of violating a federal law designed to stop foreign militaries from enlisting child soldiers, according to internal documents reviewed by Reuters. A confidential State Department “dissent” memo, which Reuters was first to report on, said Tillerson breached the Child Soldiers Prevention Act when he decided in June to exclude Iraq, Myanmar, and Afghanistan from a U.S. list of offenders in the use of child soldiers. This was despite the department publicly acknowledging that children were being conscripted in those countries. [tmsnrt.rs/2jJ7pav] Keeping the countries off the annual list makes it easier to provide them with U.S. military assistance. Iraq and Afghanistan are close allies in the fight against Islamist militants, while Myanmar is an emerging ally to offset China’s influence in Southeast Asia. Documents reviewed by Reuters also show Tillerson’s decision was at odds with a unanimous recommendation by the heads of the State Department’s regional bureaus overseeing embassies in the Middle East and Asia, the U.S. envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, the department’s human rights office and its own in-house lawyers. [tmsnrt.rs/2Ah6tB4]    “Beyond contravening U.S. law, this decision risks marring the credibility of a broad range of State Department reports and analyses and has weakened one of the U.S. government's primary diplomatic tools to deter governmental armed forces and government-supported armed groups from recruiting and using children in combat and support roles around the world,” said the July 28 memo. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, questioned at length by reporters on the issue at her daily briefing, strongly defended Tillerson’s decision as valid and in “technical compliance with the law in the way he read it.” “No one in the United States government likes the idea of the use of child soldiers,” she said. “It’s abhorrent. Asked at a photo opportunity with the visiting Peruvian foreign minister about his decision, Tillerson sidestepped any direct response to the dissenting officials’ complaint.  Reuters reported in June that Tillerson had disregarded internal recommendations on Iraq, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The new documents reveal the scale of the opposition in the State Department, including the rare use of what is known as the  “dissent channel,” which allows officials to object to policies without fear of reprisals. The views expressed by the U.S. officials illustrate ongoing tensions between career diplomats and the former chief of Exxon Mobil Corp appointed by President Donald Trump to pursue  an “America First” approach to diplomacy.      The child soldiers law passed in 2008 states that the U.S. government must be satisfied that no children under the age of 18 “are recruited, conscripted or otherwise compelled to serve as child soldiers” for a country to be removed from the list. The statute extends specifically to government militaries and government-supported armed groups like militias. The list currently includes the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Mali, Sudan, Syria and Yemen.     In a written response to the dissent memo on Sept. 1, Tillerson adviser Brian Hook acknowledged that the three countries did use child soldiers. He said, however, it was necessary to distinguish between governments “making little or no effort to correct their child soldier violations ... and those which are making sincere - if as yet incomplete - efforts.” [tmsnrt.rs/2zWGRt0]Hook made clear that America’s top diplomat used what he sees as his discretion to interpret the law. Foreign militaries on the list are prohibited from receiving aid, training and weapons from Washington unless the White House issues a waiver based on U.S. “national interest.” In 2016, under the Obama administration, both Iraq and Myanmar, as well as others such as Nigeria and Somalia, received waivers.    At times, the human rights community chided President Barack Obama for being too willing to issue waivers and exemptions, especially for governments that had security ties with Washington, instead of sanctioning more of those countries. “Human Rights Watch frequently criticized President Barack Obama for giving too many countries waivers, but the law has made a real difference,” Jo Becker, advocacy director for the group’s children’s rights division, wrote in June in a critique of Tillerson’s decision. The dissenting U.S. officials stressed that Tillerson’s decision to exclude Iraq, Afghanistan and Myanmar went a step further than the Obama administration’s waiver policy by contravening the law and effectively easing pressure on the countries to eradicate the use of child soldiers.     The officials acknowledged in the documents reviewed by Reuters that those three countries had made progress. But in their reading of the law, they said that was not enough to be kept off a list that has been used to shame governments into completely eradicating the use of child soldiers. Ben Cardin, ranking Democrat on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to Tillerson on Friday saying there were “serious concerns that the State Department may not be complying” with the law and that the secretary’s decision “sent a powerful message to these countries that they were receiving a pass on their unconscionable actions.” The memo was among a series of previously unreported documents sent this month to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the State Department’s independent inspector general’s office that relate to allegations that Tillerson violated the child soldiers law. Legal scholars say that because of the executive branch’s latitude in foreign policy there is little legal recourse to counter Tillerson’s decision.    Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University in Washington, said U.S. courts would be unlikely to accept any challenge to Tillerson’s interpretation of the child soldiers law as allowing him to remove a country from the list on his own discretion.    The signatories to the document were largely senior policy experts with years of involvement in the issues, said an official familiar with the matter. Reuters saw a copy of the document that did not include the names of those who signed it.    Tillerson’s decision to remove Iraq and Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, from the list and reject a recommendation by U.S. officials to add Afghanistan was announced in the release of the government’s annual human trafficking report on June 27.     Six days earlier, a previously unreported memo emailed to Tillerson from a range of senior diplomats said the three countries violated the law based on evidence gathered by U.S. officials in 2016 and recommended that he approve them for the new list.     It noted that in Iraq, the United Nations and non-governmental organizations “reported that some Sunni tribal forces ... recruited and used persons younger than the age of 18, including instances of children taking a direct part in hostilities.”     Ali Kareem, who heads Iraq’s High Committee for Human Rights, denied the country’s military or state-backed militias use child soldiers. “We can say today with full confidence that we have a clean slate on child recruitment issues,” he said.      The memo also said “two confirmed cases of child recruitment” by the Myanmar military “were documented during the reporting period.” Human rights advocates have estimated that dozens of children are still conscripted there.     Myanmar government spokesman Zaw Htay challenged accusers to provide details of where and how child soldiers are being used. He noted that in the latest State Department report on human trafficking, “they already recognized (Myanmar) for reducing of child soldiers” – though the report also made clear some children were still conscripted.     The memo said further there was “credible evidence” that a government-supported militia in Afghanistan “recruited and used a child,” meeting the minimum threshold of a single confirmed case that the State Department had previously used as the legal basis for putting a country on the list.     The Afghan defense and interior ministries both denied there were any child soldiers in Afghan national security forces, an assertion that contradicts the State Department’s reports and human rights activists.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday stood by his criticism of pay TV and wireless company AT&T’s deal to buy movie and TV show maker Time Warner Inc, which the Justice Department has sued to stop. “I’m not going to get involved in litigation, but personally I’ve always felt that that was a deal that’s not a good deal for the country,” the president said on the lawn of the White House as he left for Florida. “I think your pricing’s going to go up, I don’t think it’s a good deal for the country.” The case will be more closely watched than other merger challenges because Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner’s CNN, and opposed AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner on the campaign trail last year, saying it would concentrate too much power in AT&T’s hands. Until Tuesday, he had not repeated that criticism. The U.S. Department of Justice on Monday sued AT&T, arguing that it would use Time Warner’s content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.” The Justice Department pushed back any suggestion that the decision to sue was done because of “political considerations.” “This is a law enforcement decision, not a political one. The DOJ has reached the end of a year-long investigation by a large, capable staff of expert lawyers and economists,” a Justice Department spokesperson said in an email comment. “The division concluded on the merits that the merger is illegal under the antitrust laws because it will hurt competition.” AT&T has vowed to defend the $85.4 billion deal in court. The Department of Justice’s move to block it was “foolish” because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrier’s trial lawyer, Dan Petrocelli, told CNBC on Tuesday. ""We want to go to court as soon as possible,"" Petrocelli told CNBC, saying the burden of proof was on the government. cnb.cx/2AjiOVw AT&T will ask the court for an expedited trial next week, a source familiar with case said.  The case has been assigned to Judge Richard Leon, a senior judge on the District of Columbia District Court, who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Time Warner shares went higher when Leon’s assignment was announced as investors bet the judge would be more likely to allow the deal to proceed.  Republican-appointed judges are generally, but not always, more business-friendly than those appointed by Democrats. Shares of Time Warner closed up 2.1 percent at $89.56 on Tuesday, signaling that investors believe the deal has a better chance of being approved. AT&T closed down less than 1 percent at $34.33. The merger challenge is unusual since the two companies do not compete directly.  The Justice Department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal - where the merging companies are not direct competitors, as is the case with AT&T and Time Warner - since the 1970s, when it prevented Ford Motor Co from buying assets from spark-plug maker Autolite.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - With NAFTA talks grinding toward stalemate, U.S. President Donald Trump may be tempted to carry out his threat to withdraw from the trade pact, but legal experts say such a decision  could be defeated, or delayed significantly by court challenges. The constitutional and statutory authority for who can terminate the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement - Trump or the U.S. Congress - is deeply disputed, and it may take the U.S. Supreme Court or a truce between the White House and Capitol Hill to sort it out.    Private sector executives said that major U.S. business groups are preparing legal challenges to any withdrawal by the  United States, although the plaintiffs had not yet been determined. Litigation would lay bare the fault lines between Trump’s populist vision and the pro-trade, business friendly lawmakers of his Republican Party, many of whom are increasingly nervous that NAFTA will collapse and cause economic damage.. “I think this is headed for a huge legal morass if the president were to unilaterally send a notice of withdrawal,” said Jennifer Hillman, a Georgetown University law professor and former World Trade Organization (WTO) appellate judge. “There will be immediate challenges across the board.”    NAFTA’s original text allows a country to withdraw from the agreement six months after it provides written notice to the other parties, but neither the agreement nor U.S. implementing legislation specifies how that should be decided. Once the six-month period ends, the president can declare the restoration of U.S. tariffs on Canada and Mexico to WTO levels, although some legal experts say Congress may ultimately have authority over this. The three countries were wrapping up a fifth round of talks to update NAFTA on Tuesday with major differences yet to be resolved. The NAFTA implementing law would be untouched by a Trump withdrawal, creating what some call a “zombie” trade pact without tariff-free access, but other provisions would remain. Some of those rules are opposed by the Trump administration, including the “Chapter 19” arbitration system that often thwarts U.S. anti-dumping cases against Canada and Mexico, as well as labor, environmental and regional content requirements that U.S. officials see as weak. Trump would need Congress’ approval to repeal that law. Winning that vote could be extremely difficult, as most congressional Republicans follow their business and farm constituents in being advocates of free trade in general and NAFTA in particular. “The president would want to get Congress on board so that the implementing legislation is coherent,” said Dean Pinkert, a trade lawyer and former U.S. International Trade Commission member. Almost any court challenge would argue that Trump needs congressional approval to quit NAFTA because Congress has explicit authority in the U.S. Constitution over tariffs and trade. But the president historically has held power over foreign policy matters such as international treaties. The Supreme Court is often reluctant to rule on questions of authority between the executive and legislative branches of government and prefers legislative solutions instead. In a 1979 case, the court sided with President Jimmy Carter after Senator Barry Goldwater challenged his authority to nullify a defense treaty with Taiwan. But that pact did not  have a trade component and was clearly a foreign policy issue. If the Supreme Court did rule on a NAFTA withdrawal challenge, much would depend on how the case is argued, said     Tim Meyer, an international law professor at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.  “If the case is successfully framed as to who has authority over foreign affairs, I think the president wins,” Meyer said. Georgetown University’s Hillman said her reading of the constitutional question and implementing legislation stacks up against Trump - that Congress only explicitly intended for the president to implement NAFTA, not the reverse. “NAFTA unequivocally falls under the commerce clause of the Constitution,” Hillman said.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice’s move to block AT&T Inc’s $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc was “foolish” because the deal posed no threat to consumers, the wireless carrier’s trial lawyer Dan Petrocelli told CNBC on Tuesday. The Justice Department on Monday sued AT&T arguing that the U.S. No. 2 wireless carrier would use Time Warner’s content to force rival pay-TV companies to pay “hundreds of millions of dollars more per year for Time Warner’s networks.” AT&T has vowed to defend the deal. “We want to go to court as soon as possible,” Petrocelli told CNBC, saying the burden of proof was on the government.  The case was initially assigned on Tuesday to Judge Christopher Cooper in federal court in Washington but later reassigned to Judge Richard Leon.  The case will be closely watched because U.S. President Donald Trump has been a vocal critic of Time Warner’s CNN, and opposed AT&T’s purchase of Time Warner on the campaign trail last year, saying it would concentrate too much power in AT&T’s hands.  In antitrust circles, the court fight will be closely watched since the Justice Department has not successfully litigated to stop a vertical deal - where the merging companies are not direct competitors - since the 1970s, when it prevented Ford Motor Co from buying assets from spark-plug maker Autolite.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who has raised eyebrows by mulling his power to pardon as investigators probe possible ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia, used his authority in a less controversial way on Tuesday to “pardon” a Thanksgiving turkey. Joined by his wife, Melania, and their son, Barron, Trump entered the Rose Garden for the annual presidential tradition and granted freedom to a large white bird named Drumstick. Americans traditionally feast on turkey, stuffing and other delights on the Thanksgiving holiday, which takes place this coming Thursday, but Drumstick and his pal Wishbone were granted a reprieve. “I’m pleased to report that, unlike millions of other turkeys at this time of the year, Drumstick has a very, very bright future ahead of him,” Trump said. The Republican president couldn’t resist referring to his predecessor, former Democratic President Barack Obama, who pardoned two turkeys named Tater and Tot last year. “As many of you know, I have been very active in overturning a number of executive actions by my predecessor,” Trump quipped. “However, I have been informed by the White House Counsel’s Office that Tater and Tot’s pardons cannot, under any circumstances, be revoked.” The turkeys will live at an enclosure at a nearby university, Virginia Tech. Allegations of potential ties between Trump’s presidential campaign and Moscow have loomed over the White House and investigations are ongoing. Trump and Moscow have denied collusion. In a message on Twitter in July, Trump noted that as president he had “complete power to pardon.”  ",Trump pardons turkey in annual Thanksgiving tradition

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Department of Homeland Security violated two court orders in the days after U.S. President Donald Trump issued a temporary travel ban on citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, according to the department’s watchdog. DHS Inspector General John Roth summarized his findings in a letter dated Monday to three Democratic U.S. senators, saying he has been unable to release the full 87-page report, completed six weeks ago. He said the delay was due to a dispute with DHS higher-ups over redactions, which would “deprive Congress and the public of significant insights into the operation of the Department,” Roth said. After the Jan. 27 order by the president, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) “was very aggressive in preventing affected travelers from boarding aircraft bound for the United States, and took actions that, in our view, violated two separate court orders,” Roth said. Trump banned the entry of citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. His order was issued with little warning to major U.S. agencies, sparking confusion at airports in the United States and around the world over its scope and impact. Civil rights groups quickly challenged the travel ban, managing to block implementation of some of its key measures as protesters, lawyers and elected officials rushed to major U.S. airports where citizens of the seven countries had been detained. At U.S. ports of entry, CBP officials largely complied with court orders blocking the ban, though they were hampered by a lack of guidance from superiors, Roth wrote in his letter.  CBP officials “had virtually no warning” that Trump was issuing his travel ban “or of the scope of the order, and was caught by surprise,” Roth said. Still, CBP officers at U.S. airports “attempted in good faith to obey court orders,” he said. In one case, at Dulles International Airport near Washington, CBP stopped a departing airplane that was taxiing so an affected traveler could be admitted to the United States. From Jan. 29 to Feb. 3, CBP instructed airlines to prevent Boston-bound passengers from the seven countries from flying to the United States in violation of an order by a federal court in Massachusetts. All of the airlines except Lufthansa (LHAG.DE) followed CBP instructions. When Lufthansa’s passengers arrived in Boston, they were allowed to enter, Roth said. CBP also continued to issue “no board” instructions to airlines even after a separate nationwide federal court order on Jan. 31 blocked the agency from doing so, Roth said. Top DHS officials are reviewing Roth’s report and may invoke a form of governmental privilege which he said “would prevent us from releasing to you significant portions of the report. I am very troubled by this development.” Agency officials “conducted themselves professionally, and in a legal manner, as they implemented an executive order issued by the president,” said Tyler Q. Houlton, a DHS spokesman. Parts of the report are subject to “privileges afforded by well-recognized law,” he said since the travel ban’s implementation is subject to lawsuits and court orders.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has charged a former Senegalese foreign minister and a former top Hong Kong government official with links to a Chinese energy conglomerate with bribing high-level officials in Chad and Uganda in exchange for contracts for the mainland company. Chi Ping Patrick Ho, 68, of Hong Kong, and Cheikh Gadio, 61, were charged with violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, international money laundering and conspiracy, the U.S. Justice Department said in a statement on Monday.  It said Gadio, a former foreign minister of Senegal, was arrested in New York on Friday. It added that Ho, a former Hong Kong home affairs secretary who heads a non-governmental organization based in Hong Kong and Virginia, was arrested on Saturday. “Wiring almost a million dollars through New York’s banking system in furtherance of their corrupt schemes, the defendants allegedly sought to generate business through bribes paid to the president of Chad and the Ugandan foreign minister,” Joon Kim, acting U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, was quoted as saying in the statement. No one could be reached at the embassies of Chad and Uganda in Washington late on Monday. The missions did not immediately respond to emails requesting comment. In a statement, the U.S. Justice Department said the case against Ho involved two bribery schemes to pay high-level officials of Chad and Uganda in exchange for business advantages for a Shanghai-headquartered, multibillion-dollar energy firm. This energy company funded a non-government organization (NGO) based in Hong Kong and Virginia that Ho heads, the statement said, without naming the Shanghai company or the NGO.  Ho is the secretary general of the Hong Kong-based China Energy Fund Committee, a mainland-backed think-tank that describes itself as a charitable, non-government organization.  China Energy Fund Committee is fully funded by CEFC China Energy, a Shanghai-based private conglomerate, according to the think tank’s website. The organization did not respond to an email requesting comment. CEFC China Energy said in a statement posted on its website late on Tuesday that: “As a non-governmental, non-profit organization, the fund is not involved in the commercial activities of CEFC China Energy.” CEFC does not have any investment in Uganda, the company said in the statement, and its investment in Chad had been acquired via a stake bought from Taiwan’s state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp and it had not dealt directly with the Chad government. “The company will continue monitoring this matter and will take necessary measures based on developments,” it said. CEFC has been a key player in Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road initiative, which aims to bolster China’s global leadership ambitions by building infrastructure and trade links between Asia, Africa, Europe and beyond. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang told a regular news briefing Tuesday that he was not aware of the specific details of the case. “I want to emphasize that the Chinese government consistently requires Chinese companies abroad to operate lawfully and abide by local laws and regulations.”  Idriss Deby has been Chad’s president since 1990. Ugandan Foreign Minister Sam Kutesa served as the president of the U.N. General Assembly in 2014 and 2015. Ho’s attorney, Ed Kim, of Krieger Kim & Lewin LLP, declined to comment to Reuters. Bob Baum of Federal Defenders, who represented Gadio for the bail argument, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ho was ordered detained after appearing in court on Monday, the Justice Department statement said. It said Gadio appeared before a judge on Saturday and is being held until he can meet the conditions of a $1 million bond, according to court records. The Justice Department said a $2 million bribe was paid to Chad’s president, who then provided the company with an opportunity to obtain oil rights in Chad without international competition. The department said in the statement that Gadio was the go-between and was paid $400,000 by Ho via wire transfers through New York. The Justice Department accused Ho of being involved with bribes and promises of future benefits to Uganda’s foreign minister in exchange for help in obtaining business advantages for the Chinese company.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After deep cuts in spending for Florida schools and other public programs following the Great Recession, outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott this month proposed an $87.4 billion budget he says boosts spending on some depleted services to record levels.  Despite Scott’s meaty 2018-2019 budget recommendation, which is about $2.4 billion above current spending, advocates for Florida public education, environment and affordable housing remained skeptical the new plan would go far enough. “It doesn’t move Florida (schools) out from the bottom when compared to other states,” said Mark Pudlow, spokesman for the Florida Education Association, the state’s teachers union.  Florida’s public school per-pupil spending sank from a peak of $7,126 in the 2007-2008 budget to a post-recession low of $6,217 for the 2011-2012 year.  In his latest proposal, Scott recommended increasing funding to $7,176 per student, a $50 rise above record-high per-student funding. Florida has more than 2.7 million students enrolled in its public K-12 schools. Pudlow said he welcomed the governor’s increases, but support for Florida education was still lagging far behind most of the United States. The nationwide per-student spending average was $11,392 in 2015, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau data available. Adjusted for inflation, Pudlow pointed out, Scott’s budget puts Florida’s per-student spending at about $1,200 less than it was at its peak. Scott proposed increasing public elementary and secondary school spending to about $14.71 billion from some $14.45 billion in the current fiscal year.  Andrea Messina, executive director of the Florida School Boards Association, said she was hopeful Scott’s proposal signaled a an attitude shift in the state capital toward public education financing, but the bill was far from final. The Florida House of Representatives and Senate will hear the governor’s budget recommendations at the next legislative session starting on Jan. 9. They then make their own budget proposals and negotiate until a single plan is agreed on.  That budget will go back to the governor, who has the authority to veto line items before signing off on the bill. Scott has also proposed $180 million in cuts to taxes and fees and asked for sharp increases in spending on departments, including corrections, which would see more than 500 added jobs under the plan.  The budget for environmental protection would surge to more than $1.7 billion from $1.48 billion in the current year, making it among the budget’s biggest gainers. Florida Everglades restoration would be among the environmental projects to receive an infusion of funds. “That’s one place where we’re happy, although the devil is in the details,” said Frank Jackalone, director of Sierra Club Florida. Jackalone said he was concerned the state would continue to cut environmental rules enforcement and to take from earmarked funds intended for the environment to spend on other government programs. State Representative Carlos Smith, a Democrat who represents a central Florida district seeing an influx of residents fleeing from hurricane-battered areas, including Puerto Rico, said he opposed Scott’s budget proposal on affordable housing. Under the plan, overall spending on affordable housing would rise, Smith said, but it would also include a raid of nearly $92 million on trust funds earmarked for affordable homes. “We don’t know what to do, people are sleeping in cars,” Smith said of storm evacuees, namely Puerto Ricans fleeing the bankrupt and hurricane-battered U.S. commonwealth.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"YANGON/NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Members of the U.S. Congress said on Tuesday operations carried out against the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar had “all the hallmarks” of ethnic cleansing, while the country’s leader Aung San Suu Kyi expressed doubts about allegations of rights abuses. The U.S. Senate members also said they were disturbed by a “violent and disproportionate” security response to Rohingya militant attacks that have driven more than 600,000 people from Myanmar to neighbouring Bangladesh. Human rights monitors have accused Myanmar’s military of atrocities, including mass rape, against the stateless Rohingya during so-called clearance operations following insurgent attacks on 30 police posts and an army base. Myanmar’s government has denied most of the claims, and the army last week said its own probe found no evidence of wrongdoing by troops. “We are not hearing of any violations going on at the moment,” Suu Kyi told reporters in response to a question about human rights abuses at the end of the Asia-Europe Meeting, or ASEM, in Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw. “We can’t say whether it has happened or not. As a responsibility of the government, we have to make sure that it won’t happen.” Nobel laureate Suu Kyi said she hoped talks with Bangladesh’s foreign minister this week would lead to a deal on the “safe and voluntary return” of those who have fled. Suu Kyi’s less than two-year old civilian government has faced heavy international criticism for its response to the crisis, though it has no control over the generals it has to share power with under Myanmar’s transition to power after decades of military rule. While a top UN official has described the military’s actions as a textbook case of “ethnic cleansing”, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on a visit to Myanmar last week refused to label it as such. In early November, U.S. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on Myanmar military officials. Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley, who was among the sponsors of the legislation introduced in the Senate, led a congressional delegation that visited Rakhine this week, but was blocked from traveling to the violence-hit north of the state and to Rohingya camps. The group also traveled to Cox’s Bazar district in Bangladesh, where Rohingya refugees are huddled into makeshift camps and fed by overstretched aid agencies. “Many refugees have suffered direct attacks including loved ones, children and husbands being killed in front of them, wives and daughters being raped, burns and other horrific injuries. This has all the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing,” Merkley told reporters in Myanmar on Tuesday. “We are profoundly disturbed by the violent and disproportionate response against the Rohingya by the military and local groups,” he said. The delegation called for Myanmar to allow an investigation into the alleged atrocities that would involve the international community. “We want to emphasize that the world is watching,” Merkley said, adding that it was important Myanmar allow anyone who wants to come back to return to their homes and their farms. Merkley said the delegation was “not here today to recommend…what the U.S. government would do or should do,” when asked about the legislation introduced in the Congress. Myanmar officials have so far said they plan to resettle most returnees in new “model villages”, rather than on the land they previously occupied, an approach the United Nations has criticized in the past as effectively creating permanent camps. “Individuals cannot be coming back…simply to return to camps where there would be continued discrimination, restrictions on full participation in the economy and society,” said Merkley. He warned that isolating people in camps creates a “two-tier society that is fundamentally incompatible with the future of democracy and it guarantees perpetuation of suspicions and misunderstandings and conflicts.” Speaking earlier on Tuesday, Suu Kyi said discussions would be held with the Bangladesh foreign minister on Wednesday and Thursday about repatriation. Officials from both countries began talks last month on how to process the Rohingya wanting to return. “We hope that this would result in an MOU signed quickly, which would enable us to start the safe and voluntarily return of all of those who have gone across the border,” Suu Kyi said. The Rohingya are largely stateless and many people in Myanmar view them as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Suu Kyi said Myanmar would follow the framework of an  agreement reached in the 1990s to cover the earlier repatriation of Rohingya, who had fled to Bangladesh to escape previous bouts of ethnic violence. That agreement did not address the citizenship status of Rohingya, and Bangladesh has been pressing for a repatriation process that provided Rohingya with more safeguards this time. “It’s on the basis of residency...this was agreed by the two governments long time ago with success, so this will be formula we will continue to follow,” Suu Kyi said. Earlier talks between the two countries reached a broad agreement to work out a repatriation deal, but a senior Myanmar official later accused Bangladesh of dragging its feet in order to secure funding from aid agencies for hosting the refugees.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday to allow President Donald Trump’s latest travel ban to take full effect after an appeals court in California ruled last week that only parts of it could be enacted. A three-judge panel of the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Nov. 13 partially granted a Trump administration request to block at least temporarily a judge’s ruling that had put the new ban on hold. It ruled the government could bar entry of people from six Muslim-majority countries with no connections to the United States. Trump’s ban was announced on Sept. 24 and replaced two previous versions that had been impeded by federal courts. The administration’s appeal to the top U.S. court argued that the latest travel ban differed from the previous orders “both in process and in substance” and that the differences showed it “is based on national-security and foreign-affairs objectives, not religious animus.”     It also argued that even if the 9th Circuit ruled to uphold the partial ban, the Supreme Court was likely to overturn that decision as it had “the last time courts barred the President from enforcing entry restrictions on certain foreign nationals in the interest of national security.” Last week’s appeals court ruling meant the ban would only apply to people from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia and Chad who did not have connections to the United States.   Those connections are defined as family relationships and “formal, documented” relationships with U.S.-based entities such as universities and resettlement agencies. Those with family relationships that would allow entry include grandparents, grandchildren, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, uncles, nieces, nephews and cousins of people in the United States. The state of Hawaii, which sued to block the restrictions, argued that federal immigration law did not give Trump the authority to impose them on six of those countries. The lawsuit did not challenge restrictions toward people from the two other countries listed in Trump’s ban, North Korea and Venezuela.     U.S. District Judge Derrick Watson in Honolulu ruled last month that Hawaii was likely to succeed with its argument. Trump issued his first travel ban targeting several Muslim-majority countries in January, just a week after he took office, and then issued a revised one after the first was blocked by the courts. The second one expired in September after a long court fight and was replaced with another revised version. Trump has said the travel ban is needed to protect the United States from attacks by Islamist militants. As a candidate, Trump promised “a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.” Critics of the travel ban in its various iterations call it a “Muslim ban” that violates the U.S. Constitution by discriminating on the basis of religion. The 9th Circuit is due to hear oral arguments in the case on Dec. 6. In a parallel case from Maryland, a judge also ruled against the Trump administration and partially blocked the ban from going into effect. An appeal in the Maryland case is being heard on Dec. 8 by the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia. The Maryland case was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents several advocacy groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project.

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States in July 2019 will end a special status given to about 59,000 Haitian immigrants that protects them from deportation after a devastating 2010 earthquake, senior Trump administration officials said on Monday. The decision by acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke gives Haitians 18 months to return to their impoverished Caribbean country or legalize their status in the United States. Former President Barack Obama’s administration granted Haitian nationals in the United States so-called Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for 18 months after a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck near Haiti’s capital, Port-au-Prince, in January 2010, killing more than 300,000 people. The Obama administration extended the status several times after the initial designation. Duke decided to terminate the special status after a U.S. review of the conditions in Haiti found the country had made considerable progress, a senior official with President Donald Trump’s administration told a briefing.   “It was assessed overall that the extraordinary but temporary conditions that served as the basis of Haiti’s most recent designation has sufficiently improved such that they no longer prevent nationals of Haiti from returning safely,” the official said. In May, then-Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly extended the status for Haitians for six months through January 2018. At the time, Kelly told reporters that TPS “is not meant to be an open-ended law but a temporary law.” The decision to end TPS for Haitians is part of Trump’s broader efforts to tighten restrictions on immigration, and comes despite calls from even some fellow Republicans to continue the relief.     Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida published an opinion piece in the Miami Herald on Friday urging the administration to renew Haiti’s TPS designation for another 18 months, citing ongoing natural disasters, health epidemics and security issues since the 2010 quake. Duke in September ended protected status for citizens of Sudan as of 2018, but extended it for citizens of South Sudan through mid-2019. This month, Duke decided to end the status for Nicaraguan immigrants, but extended the program for Honduran immigrants until July 2018.. Thousands of Nicaraguans and Hondurans received the special status in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America. The Washington Post reported that Kelly pressured Duke to end the program for Hondurans, but Duke denied the reports.  ",U.S. to end protected status for Haitians in July 2019

0,True,"November 21, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A federal court judge in California on Monday blocked an executive order from President Donald Trump to deny some federal grants to so-called sanctuary cities, undermining the administration’s crackdown on illegal immigration. The judge, who blocked the order provisionally in April, issued a permanent injunction in the suit brought by the city and county of San Francisco and Santa Clara County, which said the order was unconstitutional. “The Counties have demonstrated that the Executive Order has caused and will cause them constitutional injuries by violating the separation of powers doctrine and depriving them of their Tenth and Fifth Amendment rights,” U.S. District Judge William Orrick for the Northern District of California wrote in his order.  Trump issued the order in January, shortly after he was inaugurated, slashing funding to jurisdictions that refuse to comply with a statute that requires local governments to share information with U.S. immigration authorities. As part of that policy, the Justice Department has sought to punish cities and other local jurisdictions that have joined a growing “sanctuary” movement aimed at shielding illegal immigrants from stepped-up deportation efforts. “The district court exceeded its authority today when it barred the president from instructing his cabinet members to enforce existing law,” Department of Justice spokesman Devin O’Malley said in a statement. “The Justice Department will vindicate the president’s lawful authority to direct the executive branch.” The department has already appealed the judge’s prior ruling from April. The Trump administration contends local authorities endanger public safety when they decline to hand over for deportation illegal immigrants arrested for crimes. Dozens of local governments and cities, including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, have joined the growing “sanctuary” movement. Supporters of the sanctuary policy argue enlisting police cooperation in rounding up immigrants for removal undermines communities’ trust in local police, particularly among Latinos. The Justice Department is concerned about localities’ compliance with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement requests to detain people up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release time so that immigration officials can pick them up. Some cities say they will only honor such requests when  accompanied by criminal warrants, and that compliance is voluntary and not required under the statute. Chicago also sued the federal government in August over the threats of funding cuts by the Justice Department. A federal judge sided with the city in September and issued a preliminary injunction barring the U.S. government from denying the public-safety grants.

0,True,"November 20, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House wants to see a Republican elected to the U.S. Senate from Alabama to help pass a tax overhaul bill, a senior adviser said on Monday, indicating a possible shift toward supporting candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused of pursuing teenage girls when he was in his 30s. Moore, a former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, is the Republicans’ only realistic chance to win the special Dec. 12 election. Republicans have a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. The White House has said President Donald Trump thinks the allegations, including a charge Moore initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s, are troubling and he should step down if they are true. But it has also said it is up to the people of Alabama to make the choice for the Senate and it has not called on Moore to exit the race, as have many other leading Republicans. In an interview with Fox News Channel on Monday, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway railed against Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, has overtaken Moore in polls since allegations of sexual misconduct were first reported by the Washington Post two weeks ago. Asked if she was favoring a vote for Moore, Conway said: “We want the votes in the Senate to get this tax bill.”  The U.S. House of Representatives passed tax legislation last week. The Senate, where Republicans can afford to lose only two votes, will take up its own version next week. Last week, Conway told Fox: “There’s no Senate seat that’s worth more than a child.” Moore’s campaign has struggled since the Post detailed the accounts of four women who say Moore pursued them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. More women have since spoken out with allegations of their own. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. Moore, 70, has denied the accusations and has said he is the victim of a witch hunt. In her first televised interview since the Post detailed her allegations, Leigh Corfman told NBC’s “Today” show on Monday that Moore “basically laid out some blankets on the floor of his living room and proceeded to seduce me, I guess you would say” on her second visit to his home when she was 14 and he was 32. Corfman said that since the story in the Washington Post there have been “a lot of people that have come out and have said that because of my courage they’re able to do the same.” She said she had considered confronting Moore twice before, but did not do it, once because her school-age children were afraid that “they would be castigated in their group.” Corfman said she has not been paid by anyone for speaking up about her allegations. “If anything, it has cost me. I had to take leave from my job,” she said. ",White House wants Republican in Alabama Senate seat for tax bill vote: adviser

The pair said they were “disturbed” by the decision, and questioned whether the shift to a federal banking license allowed the bank to escape any investigations by the New York Department of Financial Supervision, where the company had bank branches. They also questioned the role of Acting Comptroller Keith Noreika, who previously counted MUFG as a client, in the decision. Noreika recused himself from the bank’s application for a federal charter, but the two senators are demanding additional details on that decision, and who was responsible for approving the bank’s charter instead. An OCC spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",U.S. senators seek details on 'dubious' oversight shift by Japanese bank

0,True,"November 20, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK(Reuters) - In August, a dozen inventors gathered around a fire pit outside the headquarters of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in Alexandria, Virginia, and set alight patents they said had been rendered worthless by an overreaching federal government.  “It’s time for us to make patents great again,” Michael Caputo, an advisor to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, told those gathered. US Inventor, the group behind the protest Caputo now represents as a spokesman, is calling for the abolition of the U.S. Patent Trial and Appeal Board, an administrative tribunal run by the patent office that reviews the validity of patents.  The rallying cry marks an about-face for some conservatives, who broadly supported the board’s creation in 2011 as a way to rein in trial lawyers and “patent trolls,” who hold patents for the sole purpose of suing big companies for licensing fees.  “Things have really flipped when it comes to the conservative perspective on patents,” said Charles Duan, a lawyer with left-leaning consumer group Public Knowledge. Much of the credit goes to activists who have convinced many conservatives that the real problem is not out-of-control litigation but how the tribunal designed to speed up resolving patent disputes favors big business over smaller rivals.  The change of positions has been aided by deepening right-wing distrust of tech giants, such as Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google, which have benefited the most from PTAB while embracing liberal causes like immigration or gay and transgender rights. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2A1LfXV) The U.S. Supreme Court is due to rule sometime next year on whether the tribunal is an unconstitutional intrusion of the executive branch onto matters reserved for the courts and influential conservative groups are already weighing in. The Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, Federalist Society, and the American Conservative Union have published articles or submitted briefs arguing that PTAB should be abolished. Most legal experts expect it to survive, though, noting the Supreme Court has largely accepted the powers of executive-branch courts in other areas, such as public employee benefits. The mounting criticism of PTAB could still convince the court’s conservative justices to vote for abolition, said Q. Todd Dickinson, a lawyer with the firm Polsinelli and a former director of the patent office.  The advocacy effort by conservative groups could also convince the Trump administration to curb the patent board’s power, Dickinson said. AN ANTI-TROLL WEAPON More than 70 percent of the Republicans in Congress backed  the legislation that created PTAB. At the time, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said the law would “help reduce unnecessary litigation against American businesses.” In February the same business lobbying group criticized PTAB for creating “cost and uncertainty for patent owners.” U.S. Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who holds patents relating to computer interfaces, was not in Congress at the time the board was created, but said conservatives’ initial intent to curb excessive litigation has gradually given way to fears that PTAB is helping the wrong businesses.   The board’s creation was pushed by big tech companies, banks and retailers, who complained they were being inundated with “troll” lawsuits.  Successfully defending a patent case in federal court often takes years and costs millions of dollars, escalating pressure to settle. PTAB offered a cheaper and faster alternative. The average cost of litigating a PTAB petition to a final decision is about $250,000, according to patent risk management company RPX Corp.  There are no juries and limited live witness testimony in PTAB proceedings, and its administrative judges apply a lower standard of proof than would be required in federal court.  About 80 percent of the patents that PTAB makes final decisions on are either partially or fully invalidated, according to a report issued in October by the patent office. But the agency also said 56 percent of patents challenged at PTAB are upheld, in part because the court frequently declines requests to review patents.  A spokesman for the patent office declined to comment.  Inventors say PTAB has made it much harder to get patents licensed by big technology, which now routinely respond to patent infringement claims by initiating PTAB proceedings.  “Patents owners who don’t have the wherewithal to withstand serial challenges to the validity of their patents just can’t license them,” said David Pridham, chief executive of Dominion Harbor, a firm that owns and attempts to license former Eastman Kodak Co patents.  Paul Morinville, a cowboy hat-wearing entrepreneur from Indiana and the founder of US Inventor, said it has become harder for him to get funding for his business based on software patents he holds.  Morinville has been speaking to Republican lawmakers and their staffers for the past four years and many conservatives credit his group with raising alarm about the patent tribunal.  “They are as close to your iconic garage inventor as you can get, so their stories really resonate,” said James Edwards, a conservative lobbyist focused on patent law. While conservative groups have been most vocal, the debate transcends party lines. Some Republicans, such as Representative Darrell Issa of California, keep supporting the PTAB, while some Democrats have joined Republicans in calls to curb its powers.  Many trial lawyers whose case loads have fallen also oppose it. But many liberals have embraced PTAB as a means of eliminating brand-name pharmaceutical patents that keep drug prices high. Generic drug makers and large tech companies are also among the board’s supporters, arguing it has actually increased competition by weeding out low-quality patents. The conservative backlash in part reflects how the right views tech giants like Apple and Google, which thanks to the tribunal have prevailed in hundreds of disputes with patent owners seeking hefty compensation.  “Google, Amazon, and Apple and other big tech companies - you look at their power and it is really astounding. And they are generally left-leaning companies,” said Matthew Dowd, a conservative patent lawyer in Washington D.C. who has represented US Inventor. “Those dynamics are definitely playing into the increasing willingness of conservatives to speak up about patents.” ",U.S. patent review board becomes conservative target
0,True,"November 20, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump predicted on Sunday that Senator Jeff Flake will oppose the Republican tax bill, but the senator’s office says he has not yet made up his mind. “Senator Flake is still reviewing the tax reform bill on its merits. How he votes on it will have nothing to do with the president,” a spokesman for the senator said in an email.  That is contrary to an assertion made by Trump on Sunday in a post on Twitter. “He’ll be a NO on tax cuts because his political career anyway is ‘toast.’,” Trump wrote of Flake on Twitter.  Where individual Republican senators stand on the tax bill has become the focus of those trying to determine whether it will pass because Republicans control only 52 seats in the Senate.  More than two Republican defections would likely kill the bill. Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson has already publicly stated he opposes the bill in its current form. The House voted last week to approve the tax bill with no support from Democrats and 13 Republicans defecting. Trump and Flake, both Republicans, have been critical of each other in recent months. Flake delivered a speech on the Senate floor in October during which he said Trump threatened the nation’s democracy. In the same speech, Flake announced he would not be seeking re-election to the Senate next year when his term expires.  Trump has in turn been critical of Flake, saying he would not be able to win re-election.  On Saturday at an event in Arizona, Flake was overheard on a nearby microphone talking with Mesa Mayor John Giles about Trump.  “If we become the party of Roy Moore and Donald Trump, we are toast,” Flake said, according to television station KNXV, whose microphone recorded him.  Moore, who is the Republican candidate for a Senate seat in Alabama, has faced sexual misconduct allegations, and Republican leaders in Congress have urged him to drop out of the Dec. 12 special election.    In his Twitter post on Sunday, Trump also suggested that Flake intentionally made those remarks in order to be heard.  “Sen. Jeff Flake(y), who is unelectable in the Great State of Arizona (quit race, anemic polls) was caught (purposely) on “mike” saying bad things about your favorite President,” Trump wrote on Twitter.

0,True,"November 20, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A bipartisan Harvard University project aimed at protecting elections from hacking and propaganda will release its first set of recommendations today on how U.S. elections can be defended from hacking attacks. The 27-page guidebook shown to Reuters ahead of publication calls for campaign leaders to emphasize security from the start and insist on practices such as two-factor authentication for access to email and documents and fully encrypted messaging via services including Signal and Wickr. The guidelines are intended to reduce risks in low-budget local races as well as the high-stakes Congressional midterm contests next year. Though most of the suggestions cost little or nothing to implement and will strike security professionals as common sense, notorious attacks including the leak of the emails of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chair, John Podesta, have succeeded because basic security practices were not followed. The ongoing effort is being led by the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs, based at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, and is drawing on top security executives from companies including Google, Facebook and the cyber security firm CrowdStrike. The guidebook will be available online (here). “We heard from campaigns that there is nothing like this that exists,” said Debora Plunkett, a 31-year veteran of the National Security Agency who joined the Belfer Center this year. “We had security experts who understood security and election experts who understood campaigns, and both sides were eager to learn how the other part worked.” Plunkett said the goal was a digestible outline that was both realistic and helpful, and that leadership buy-in was critical. The handbook is the first effort from the Belfer Center’s four-month-old Defending Digital Democracy program, whose leadership includes top campaign officials from both the Republican and Democratic parties. Belfer co-director Eric Rosenbach said another guidebook, scheduled for spring, will aim at state election officials, who oversee the actual vote-counting and might also have to deal with propaganda intended to mislead or dissuade voters or sow suspicions about election integrity. “Deterring information operations is inherently a government responsibility, and the technology firms will decide how to act on their platforms, but state organizations are the victims,” Rosenbach said.  The Belfer Center is also sending students out to the states to understand various voting technologies and procedures. The idea is to recommend best practices for each type of set-up, which could include mandated software updates, paper back-ups and audits. Thus far, the project has offered no advice for the internet companies that are under fire for allowing Russian advertising and false claims to polarize Americans. That could come later, as could a broader program for quick sharing of threat information. ",Bipartisan Harvard panel recommends hacking safeguards for elections
0,True,"November 19, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump would not insist on including repeal of an Obama-era health insurance mandate in a bill intended to enact the biggest overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s, a senior White House aide said on Sunday. The version of tax legislation put forward by Senate Republican leaders would remove a requirement in former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law that taxes Americans who decline to buy health insurance. “If we can repeal part of Obamacare as part of a tax bill ... that can pass, that’s great,” White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. “If it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we are OK with taking it out.” It was too soon to say whether eliminating the repeal of the so-called individual mandate would increase the bill’s chances of passing. The provision was not an impediment now, Mulvaney said. Republican senators who have been critical of the plan said that some middle-income taxpayers could see any benefits of the tax cuts wiped out by higher health insurance premiums if the repeal of the Obamacare mandate goes through. Among them was Senator Susan Collins, one of a handful of Republicans who voted in July to block a broader Republican attempt to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. “I don’t think that provision should be in the bill. I hope the Senate will follow the lead of the House and strike it,” Collins said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” Republicans can only afford to lose two votes on the tax bill because of their slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. Getting rid of the mandate is one of Republican Trump’s main goals. He campaigned for president last year on a promise to repeal and replace Obamacare, but Congress has not agreed so far on how to do that. Another top Trump administration official, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, said the individual mandate “isn’t a bargaining chip.” “The president thinks we should get rid of it and I think we should get rid of it,” he told “Fox News Sunday.”  Mnuchin said the objective “right now” was to keep repeal of the mandate in the bill. “We are going to work with the Senate as we go through this. We are going to get something to the president to sign this year,” he said. The House of Representatives last week passed its tax bill. Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, consider a tax bill critical to their party’s prospects in the 2018 U.S. congressional elections. Democrats call the Republican plan a giveaway to corporations and the rich. Trump had urged lawmakers to add repeal of the mandate to the tax bill, writing on Twitter last week that the provision was “unfair” and “highly unpopular.” The next day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did just that. The mandate plays a critical role in Obamacare by requiring young, healthy people, who might otherwise go without coverage, to purchase insurance and help offset the costs of covering sicker and older Americans. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has said that repealing the mandate would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027. Republican Senator Roy Blunt said he thought the Senate bill would pass with or without the individual mandate repeal. “It depends on where the votes are,” he told NBC’s “Meet the Press.” Appearing on several television shows, Collins said she also wanted the Senate to “skew more of the relief to middle-income taxpayers.” She advocated keeping the top tax rate of 39.6 percent for people who make $1 million or more a year, as the House does, as well as the deduction for state and local taxes. The corporate tax does not need to be cut so steeply to 20 percent, Collins said. A 22 percent rate would garner an additional $200 billion and allow the Senate to restore the deduction for state and local property taxes, she told ABC. Collins has emerged as a pivotal lawmaker in the tax debate, along with Republican Senators John McCain, Lisa Murkowski and Ron Johnson, all of whom are also on the fence or oppose the bill. The Senate bill needs work, Collins told ABC’s “This Week.”  “I want to see changes in that bill,” she said. “And I think there will be changes.” ",Trump open to dropping healthcare provision in Senate tax bill: aide

0,True,"November 18, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. nuclear commander said on Saturday that he would resist President Donald Trump if he ordered an “illegal” launch of nuclear weapons. Air Force General John Hyten, commander of the U.S. Strategic Command (STRATCOM), told an audience at the Halifax International Security Forum in Nova Scotia, Canada that he had given a lot of thought to what he would say if he received such an order. “I think some people think we’re stupid,” Hyten said in response to a question about such a scenario. “We’re not stupid people. We think about these things a lot. When you have this responsibility, how do you not think about it?” Hyten, who is responsible for overseeing the U.S. nuclear arsenal, explained the process that would follow such a command.  As head of STRATCOM “I provide advice to the president, he will tell me what to do,” he said in his remarks, retransmitted in a video posted on the forum’s Facebook page.  “And if it’s illegal, guess what’s going to happen? I’m going to say, ‘Mr. President, that’s illegal.’ And guess what he’s going to do? He’s going to say, ‘What would be legal?’ And we’ll come up with options, of a mix of capabilities to respond to whatever the situation is, and that’s the way it works. It’s not that complicated.” Hyten said running through scenarios of how to react in the event of an illegal order was standard practice, and added:   “If you execute an unlawful order, you will go to jail. You could go to jail for the rest of your life.” The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Hyten’s remarks. They came after questions by U.S. senators, including Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans, about Trump’s  authority to wage war, use nuclear weapons and enter into or end international agreements, amid concern that tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs could lead to hostilities. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and threatened in his maiden United Nations address to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people if it threatened the United States. Some senators want legislation to alter the nuclear authority of the U.S. president and a Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president’s authority to launch a nuclear strike.

0,True,"November 17, 2017 ",politicsNews,"HAVANA (Reuters) - An association of Cuban businesswomen has asked to meet with Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida to explain the impact on the country’s nascent private sector of rolling back a detente in U.S. relations. Rubio, a Cuban-American politician who advocates a “no contact” policy with the Communist-run island, has advised President Donald Trump on Cuba policy and welcomed his reversal of the Obama administration’s efforts at a rapprochement. “The current situation has us very worried and we would like to share our personal histories and perspective from Cuba,” the association, which represents women who own small businesses, said in a letter to Rubio last month. The entrepreneurs took advantage of an economic opening under President Raul Castro to build businesses, which they said took off as more Americans visited Cuba from 2015 in the wake of the detente. Now, they say those businesses are imploding. They would like Rubio, who was born in the United States and has never been to Cuba, to visit the Caribbean island and witness the impact of U.S. policy. “We want to invite him or part of his team to come and learn about Cuba, the Cubans here and our businesses,” said Niuris Higueras, owner of the Atelier restaurant in Havana, where she said business is down 60 percent from a year ago. The association said Rubio’s office had not responded to their letters but they would continue to seek a meeting.  His office did not respond to requests for comment. Rubio welcomed Trump’s announcement in June that he would reverse former President Barack Obama’s policies in Cuba until democracy was restored but he said this month that new restrictions on business and travel did not go far enough.   The entrepreneurs say they speak for much of Cuba’s private sector, which employs 600,000 of the island’s 11 million people.  “We began to have a lot of cancellations after President Trump in June made his statement ending Obama’s policy,” said Nidialys Acosta, who runs a business renting vintage U.S. automobiles, Nastalgicar. “People said they were scared and uncertain.” Julia de la Rosa, who runs a 10 room bed and breakfast, said rentals were down 20 percent in October and she expected a further decline as new U.S. regulations on individual travel kick in this month. The new rules limit individual travel, make group visits more onerous and ban Americans from doing business with or patronizing 180 Cuban military-run businesses and their products. “We are not asking for anything. Simply that they do not take from us the opportunity to keep working,” de la Rosa said. ",Cuban businesswomen seek Rubio meeting as U.S. policy bites
0,True,"November 17, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a move certain to please conservatives, President Donald Trump on Friday added five names to his list of candidates for a prospective U.S. Supreme Court vacancy as he presses ahead with a campaign to move the federal judiciary to the right. Two of them are appellate judges who were nominated by Trump earlier this year and confirmed by the Senate: Amy Coney Barrett and Kevin Newsom. Another, Brett Kavanaugh, sits on the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, long viewed as a stepping-stone to the high court.  The others were Britt Grant, a Georgia Supreme Court justice, and Patrick Wyrick, a Oklahoma Supreme Court justice. There is no current vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court but three justices are 79 or older. During his presidential campaign last year, Trump identified 20 conservative candidates for the Supreme Court. Upon taking office, he named Neil Gorsuch to the court to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, restoring the Supreme Court’s conservative majority. Gorsuch was confirmed by the Senate in April and has established himself as one of the Supreme Court’s most conservative justices. Speaking at a Federalist Society conference of conservative legal advocates, White House Counsel Donald McGahn said Trump is “very committed” to appointing judges who are “committed originalists and textualists,” referring to a legal philosophy that relies on the actual wording of laws and the original meaning of the U.S. Constitution.  “They all have paper trails. They all are sitting judges. There is nothing unknown about them. What you see is what you get,” McGahn said. The five jurists, all with strong conservative credentials, were added to the list with input from conservative leaders, and should another seat on the court open up, Trump will nominate a candidate from the updated list of 25, the White House said. Leonard Leo, an advisor to the president on Supreme Court nominations, said Trump thought it was time to refresh the original list. “When you’re committed to picking from a list you want to make sure it’s as complete as possible,” Leo said in an interview. Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the federal bench in 2006 by Republican former President George W. Bush, served as a White House counsel under Bush and worked as an assistant to Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Democratic former President Bill Clinton during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Grant and Wyrick both joined state challenges to the Affordable Care Act, Democratic former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, and Obama regulations aimed at reducing emissions from coal-burning power plants, said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative legal advocacy group.  The court currently consists of five conservatives and four liberals, with conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy sometimes joining with the liberals on high-profile issues such as gay rights and abortion. At 81, Kennedy is the second-oldest justice on the court behind liberal Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 84, and some former Kennedy clerks have said he is considering retirement. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer is 79. Should any of those step down, Trump would get a historic opportunity to shape the court in a more conservative direction for decades to come. Supreme Court appointments are lifetime jobs. Conservatives criticize the federal judiciary as too liberal, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions at the same conference lashed out at “activist judges.” Trump already has taken steps to make the federal judiciary more conservative, with 14 judicial appointees already confirmed by the Senate and more in the pipeline. Catherine Glenn Foster, president of the anti-abortion advocacy group Americans United for Life, said she was pleased with the new selections. “From their known records they tend to be strong on recognizing the protections for life,” she said in an interview.  On Friday, Republican Alabama Governor Kay Ivey said she would support her party’s Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused by several women of unwanted sexual contact, because of the importance of keeping the Senate under Republican control should another Supreme Court vacancy arise.

0,True,"November 17, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Friday said it had asked Congress for $44 billion in supplemental disaster assistance to help those hurt by recent hurricanes that hit Puerto Rico, Texas, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands, far short of the aid some officials have called for. The White House said it expected to seek additional funds after a fuller analysis. U.S. Representative Frank Pallone and Senator Ron Wyden, both Democrats, called the request “a dereliction of duty by the Trump administration to American citizens in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands that need our help. “This woefully inadequate funding request does not provide the necessary resources required to properly respond to the ongoing humanitarian crisis,” they added. Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello asked for $94.4 billion to rebuild the U.S. territory’s infrastructure. Texas was seeking $61 billion and Florida had asked for $27 billion. The $44 billion would be in addition to about $50 billion Congress previously approved for hurricane and disaster relief. White House budget director Mick Mulvaney said in a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan that the $44 billion “does not represent the final request” for assistance for the victims, especially in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, where needs were still being assessed. “At this time, the administration is requesting an additional fiscal year 2018 funding in the amount of $44 billion and the necessary authorities to address ongoing recovery efforts,” Mulvaney said in the letter. The administration also wants Congress to approve new tax relief for victims of recent California wildfires, which mirror what Congress awarded recently to hurricane victims. The White House also wants to make houses of worship eligible for disaster relief funding. Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, on Thursday dismissed the latest request as “wholly inadequate” for his state. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders defended the request. “Up until this point Texas has not put any state dollars into this process. We feel strongly that they should step up and play a role and work with the federal government in this process. We did a thorough assessment and that was completed and this was the number that we put forward to Congress today,” she said. She said the new request “primarily addresses Texas and Florida Those storms took place ahead of Puerto Rico. The assessment for Puerto Rico hasn’t been completed yet.

0,True,"November 18, 2017 ",politicsNews,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Pro-trade Republicans in the U.S. Congress are growing worried that U.S. President Donald Trump may try to quit the NAFTA free trade deal entirely rather than negotiate a compromise that preserves its core benefits. As a fifth round of talks to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement kicked off in Mexico on Friday, several Republicans interviewed by Reuters expressed concerns that tough U.S. demands, including a five-year sunset clause and a U.S.-specific content rule, will sink the talks and lead to the deal’s collapse. Business groups have warned of dire economic consequences, including millions of jobs lost as Mexican and Canadian tariffs snap back to their early 1990s levels.  “I think the administration is playing a pretty dangerous game with this sunset provision,” said Representative Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from eastern Pennsylvania. He said putting NAFTA under threat of extinction every five years would make it difficult for companies in his district, ranging from chocolate giant Hershey Co to small family owned manufacturing firms, to invest in supply chains and manage global operations. Hershey operates candy plants in Monterrey and Guadalajara, Mexico. Some 74 House of Representatives members signed a letter this week opposing U.S. proposals on automotive rules of origin, which would require 50 percent U.S. content in NAFTA-built vehicles and 85 percent regional content. They warned that this would “eliminate the competitive advantages” that NAFTA brings to U.S. automakers or lead to a collapse of the trade pact. Representative Pete Sessions, a Texas Republican who has long been a supporter of free trade deals, said he disagreed with the Trump approach of “trying to beat someone” in the NAFTA talks. Texas is the largest U.S. exporting state with nearly half of its $231 billion in exports last year headed to Mexico and Canada, according to Commerce Department data. “We need to offer Mexico a fair deal. If we want them to take our cattle, we need to take their avocados,” Sessions said. Still, congressional apprehension about Trump’s stance is far from unanimous. The signers were largely Republicans, with no Democrats from auto-intensive states such as Michigan and Ohio signing. Some pro-labor Democrats have actually expressed support for U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer’s tough approach. “Some of those demands are in tune,” said Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Ways and Means trade subcommittee. “We don’t want to blow it up, Republicans don’t want to blow it up. But we want substantial changes in the labor, the environmental, the currency, on how you come to an agreement when there’s a dispute, and on problems of origin.” Farm state Republicans are especially concerned that a collapse of NAFTA would lead to the loss of crucial export markets in Mexico and Canada for corn, beef and other products.  Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa said Lighthizer in a recent meeting agreed that a withdrawal from NAFTA would be hard on U.S. agriculture, which has largely benefited from the trade pact. U.S. agricultural exports to Canada and Mexico quintupled to about $41 billion in 2016 from about $9 billion in 1993, the year before NAFTA went into effect, according to U.S. Commerce Department data. Grassley said, however, that Lighthizer’s approach was “taking everybody to the brink on these talks.” Other Republicans are taking a wait and see approach to the talks. Representative Frank Lucas of Oklahoma said he was willing to give Trump “the benefit of the doubt” on NAFTA talks, adding that farmers and ranchers in his rural district were strong Trump supporters in the 2016 election. “The president’s a practical fellow. When push comes to shove, he understands the base,” Lucas said. ",Pro-trade Republicans get nervous that NAFTA talks could fail
0,True,"November 18, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The outcome of Alabama’s Dec. 12 U.S. Senate election probably will not be certified until Dec. 26 at the earliest, a state official said on Friday, making it unlikely the race will affect major year-end legislation in Congress including Republican tax cuts. Republicans hold a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate. A victory by Democrat Doug Jones over Republican Roy Moore, who is facing sexual misconduct allegations, in the Alabama race would cut that margin to 51-49, making it harder for President Donald Trump’s party to win congressional passage of major legislation. Lawmakers are due to take up legislation on government funding and immigration in December and also will try to pass a sweeping Republican tax cut bill ahead the Dec. 25 Christmas holiday. If the Alabama result is not certified until after Christmas, Republicans would have more time to get their legislative goals accomplished regardless of the Alabama contest’s outcome. John Bennett, chief of staff for the Alabama secretary of state, said the state’s 67 counties face a Dec. 22 deadline for officially reporting election results, but some are likely to miss it. Bennett said that would push the process back until after Christmas, making Dec. 26 the earliest possible date for certification. Once certified election results are available, a new senator would be sworn in during an open session of the Senate, according to Senate officials.

Trump defense lawyer John Dowd said that following payments by the Republican National Committee, the president began paying the bills and now wants to make the party “even.” The RNC confirmed it is no longer paying the bills. The expenses cover personal lawyers representing Trump in special prosecutor Robert Mueller’s probe of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia in last year’s election. Moscow has denied meddling in the election, and Trump has denied any collusion. The investigation has hounded Trump’s presidency. Mueller already has secured an indictment of Trump’s former campaign chief and another aide, while a third former adviser pleaded guilty. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has offered shifting accounts of his Russia contacts while he was a campaign adviser, including with Moscow’s former ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kislyak, and his knowledge of contacts between the campaign and Russian intermediaries. But Sessions made light of the investigation during a speech on Friday before a conservative lawyers’ group. “Is Ambassador Kislyak in the room? Before I get started here, any Russians?” Sessions said, prompting applause and laughter from the crowd at the Federalist Society event. “Anybody been to Russia? Got a cousin in Russia or something?” Special White House counsel Ty Cobb said the administration was working with others to establish a legal fund for current and former staffers. Dowd said White House counsel Don McGahn and campaign lawyer Ben Ginsberg of Jones Day are working to structure that fund, which would be subject to rules that prohibit staff from receiving gifts or pro bono legal service. The president is exempt from those rules, Dowd said. “The geniuses are working on it,” Dowd said. “If it passes muster with the tax lawyers and accountants, then it has to pass muster with the Office of Government Ethics.”  During former President Bill Clinton’s administration, private funds were raised to cover Clinton’s legal expenses related to the Whitewater investigation. Under former President George W. Bush, a legal fund was set up to help former Bush staffer Lewis “Scooter” Libby, but only after he had left White House employment. In August, Reuters first reported that the RNC was paying Trump’s legal bills, which amounted to more than $230,000 that month. The payments were made to Trump’s outside legal team, which includes Dowd.  Additionally, Trump’s re-election campaign paid more than $300,000 this year in bills to lawyers representing his son, Donald Trump Jr., according to public disclosures. The campaign did not respond to a request for comment on whether it will continue to pay for Trump Jr’s legal expenses.  The Federal Election Commission allows use of private campaign funds to pay legal bills arising from being a candidate or elected official.  While previous presidential campaigns have used these funds to pay for routine legal matters such as ballot access disputes and compliance requirements, Trump is the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use such funds on the costs of responding to a criminal probe, said election law experts.

0,True,"November 17, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The wife of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore of Alabama said on Friday her husband would not end his campaign in the wake of sexual misconduct allegations, dismissing reports about his past behavior toward some women as political attacks. “He will not step down,” Kayla Moore said at a news conference on the steps of the state capitol in Montgomery. “He will not stop fighting for the people of Alabama.” The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice’s campaign has been in turmoil since the Washington Post published a story last week detailing the accounts of three women who claim Moore pursued them while they were teenagers and he was in his 30s. More women have since spoken out with allegations of their own.  Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the accusations. Before the allegations came to light, Moore was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month. Two polls this week showed Moore now trailing Jones. Fox News released a poll on Thursday putting Jones ahead with 50 percent to 42 percent for Moore. But Moore’s embattled candidacy also got a boost on Thursday, when the Alabama Republican Party said it would continue to support him, putting it at odds with Republican leaders in Washington who want him to withdraw. Republican Alabama Governor Kay Ivey on Friday told reporters she would vote for Moore, emphasizing the importance of keeping Republican control of the U.S. Senate. Asked whether she believed the women accusing Moore of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic overtures, Ivey said, “the timing is a little curious but at the same time I have no reason to disbelieve them.” The White House has said President Donald Trump finds the allegations troubling and believes Moore should step aside if they are true. White House legislative director Marc Short on Friday said Trump previously backed Moore’s opponent, Luther Strange, in the primary contest and that Moore’s explanations “so far have not been satisfactory.”      “At this point, we believe it is up to the people of Alabama to make a decision,” Short told CNN. “The president chose a different candidate.” During the 2016 presidential campaign, several women went public with accusations that Trump had in the past made unwanted sexual advances or inappropriate personal remarks about them. Trump denied the accusations, accused rival Democrats and the media of a smear campaign, and went on to be elected president. Kayla Moore noted that the Washington Post endorsed Hillary Clinton over Trump in last year’s election, accusing it of being part of a concerted effort to push back against anti-establishment conservative candidates. “All of the very same people who were attacking President Trump are also attacking us,” she said.   The Post’s editorial board, which endorsed Clinton, works separately from the reporters and editors who work on news stories, as is common at most newspapers.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jared Kushner’s lawyer failed to give the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee documents President Donald Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser received about a “Russian backdoor overture and dinner invite,” the committee’s leaders said on Thursday. In a letter to Kushner’s attorney, Abbe Lowell, Senators Chuck Grassley and Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee’s Republican chairman and top Democrat, listed the documents and emails among materials Lowell has failed to produce. Kushner, the letter said, also forwarded to an unidentified campaign adviser emails from September 2016 concerning Wikileaks, the whistleblower group that published emails U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russian military intelligence had hacked from Democratic Party accounts. “It appears that your search may have overlooked several documents,” the letter said of Lowell’s responses to three requests for materials related to the committee’s investigation on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. “Mr. Kushner and we have been responsive to all requests,” Lowell said in a statement. “We provided the Judiciary Committee with all relevant documents that had to do with Mr. Kushner’s calls, contacts or meetings with Russians during the campaign and transition, which was the request. We also informed the committee we will be open to responding to any additional requests and that we will continue to work with White House Counsel for any responsive documents from after the inauguration.” When asked about the letter, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders referred reporters to Lowell. Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow. Russia denies a January report by three U.S. intelligence agencies that it conducted an influence operation to skew the 2016 presidential vote in favor of Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team last month subpoenaed Trump’s campaign for documents containing specified Russian keywords from more than a dozen officials. According to the Journal, a person familiar with the matter said the campaign has been complying voluntarily with the request. Grassley’s and Feinstein’s letter to Lowell also specified keywords, including Clinton, WikiLeaks, hacking, and the names of four Russian banks. Kushner remains one person of interest to the investigations by Mueller and congressional committees, according to a source with knowledge of the probes. Among other things, investigators want to know if Kushner knew during the 2016 campaign that Russia was hacking Democratic emails in an effort to help Trump and whether he tried to create a secret back channel between the Trump White House and the Kremlin, said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity. Investigators also want to know if Kushner took part in or knew of any post-election efforts by Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, or others to lift U.S. economic sanctions on Russia in exchange for financial investments or other business deals. A May 26 Reuters report quoted two sources who said Kushner and Flynn discussed with former Russian ambassador to Washington Sergey Kislyak creating a “back channel” between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin that would bypass the State Department and U.S. intelligence agencies. Flynn, a former Army general who led the Defense Intelligence Agency and later was a Trump campaign adviser, was fired in February as national security adviser after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations with Kislyak. The letter to Lowell also said he had failed to produce “communications with Sergei Millian, copied to Kushner.” Millian, who has used multiple aliases, is a Belarussian-born émigré who in 2006 helped incorporate the Russian-American Chamber of Commerce, which sponsored trips to Russia by U.S. businessmen. After a December 2011 trip arranged by the chamber and a quasi-governmental agency in Russia called Rossotrudnichestvo, FBI agents questioned participants about whether Russian spies had approached them during the visit, one of the travelers said. Millian, who met Trump on at least one occasion, has boasted of his ties to the former New York real estate developer and reality television star. He has denied being a Russian spy.

0,True,"November 17, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - From Pataskala, Ohio, to Conroe, Texas, local government leaders worry that if Republican tax-overhaul plans moving through the U.S. Congress become law, it will be harder for them to pave streets, put out fires, fight crime and pay teachers. A tax plan approved by the House of Representatives on Thursday would sharply curtail a federal deduction that millions of Americans can now claim for tax payments to state, county, city and town governments. Ending that deduction, the local leaders say, could make their taxpayers, especially in high-tax communities, less likely to support future local tax increases or even tolerate local taxes at present levels. The proposed repeal of the state and local tax (SALT) deduction is part of an “assault on local governments” by Republicans in Washington, said Elizabeth Kautz, the Republican mayor of Burnsville, Minnesota, near Minneapolis. “My hope is that we look at being thoughtful about what we’re doing and not ram something through just to get something done before the year is out,” Kautz said of the plan being rushed through Congress by her own party. In the United States, local governments run schools, operate police and fire departments and maintain streets, parks and libraries, among other essential services. The federal government’s role at that level is limited. Cities, towns, counties and states collect their own property, sales and income taxes. Under existing law, payments of those taxes can be deducted, or subtracted from federal taxable income, lowering the amount of federal tax due. The House tax bill just approved would eliminate the deduction for individuals and families of state and local income and sales tax, while capping property tax deductions at $10,000. A bill being debated in the Senate, with Republican President Donald Trump’s support, would kill the SALT deduction entirely for individuals and families, although businesses would keep it. The fate of that bill is uncertain. Ending the SALT tax break is part of a package of changes to deductions that would help Republicans raise more than $1.2 trillion in new federal tax revenues over 10 years. That increase would help offset the $1.4 trillion in revenue that would be lost from cutting the corporate tax rate, another part of both the Senate and House plans. Chuck Canterbury, president of the Fraternal Order of Police, which represents 325,000 law enforcement officers nationwide, wrote a letter to congressional leaders on Tuesday. “The FOP is very concerned that the partial or total elimination of SALT deductions will endanger the ability of our state and local government to fund these (law enforcement) agencies,” said the letter, distributed to reporters. Emily Brock, a director at the Government Finance Officers Association, said if SALT deductions were killed by Congress, voters could revolt. “Can you blame an individual taxpayer?” she asked. “They try to minimize their individual tax liability.” Those who want to curb the century-old SALT deduction argue it only motivates local governments to seek more tax increases and spend more money. “Maintaining the deduction encourages government overspending and taxation,” argues the American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit group of conservative state legislators and private activists.  Various other groups are fighting on Capitol Hill to defend the SALT deduction, such as the National Association of Realtors and the U.S. Conference of Mayors. Steve Williams, chief financial officer for Conroe, Texas,  said its rapid growth demanded new fire stations, schools, roads and public safety services. Conroe is near Houston and in the congressional district of Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax committee and a champion of restricting the SALT deduction. “Tax reform comes with picking winners and losers and I think in the final analysis, the people in (congressional) District 8 will be losers,” Williams said. Conroe is part of Montgomery County, which voted 75 percent to 22.5 percent for Trump over Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. In Pataskala, Ohio, near the state capital, Columbus, city finance director Jamie Nicholson said the local police department needed a new station. It now works out of an early 1900s building with no holding cell for suspects who are under arrest. “They get handcuffed to a chair,” he said. Given the past difficulty Pataskala has had convincing taxpayers to approve new taxes, he said, eliminating or paring back the SALT deduction might trigger demands for chopping local taxes and blow a huge hole in his budget. Greg Cox, a Republican member of the San Diego County, California, Board of Supervisors, echoed similar concerns about the impact on his community. He said the Republican plan was unfair partly because it let businesses keep the SALT deduction, while taking it away from individuals and families.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans took important steps on Thursday toward the biggest U.S. tax-code overhaul since the 1980s, with the House of Representatives approving a broad package of tax cuts, and a Senate panel advancing its own version of the legislation sought by senior lawmakers and President Donald Trump.   The House vote shifted the tax debate to the Senate, where a tax-writing panel finished debating and approved a bill late Thursday evening. That measure has already encountered resistance from some within the Republicans ranks. Full Senate action is expected after next week’s Thanksgiving holiday. Four Republican senators - enough to derail the legislation - have been talking privately about opposing the bill because it would balloon the federal deficit, according to a Time magazine report. Trump, who is still seeking his first major legislative win since taking office in January, went to the U.S. Capitol just before the House vote to urge Republicans to pass the tax bill, which Democrats call a giveaway to the wealthy and businesses. “A simple, fair and competitive tax code will be rocket fuel for our economy, and it’s within our reach. Now is the time to deliver,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said after the largely party-line House vote of 227-205.  Congress has not thoroughly overhauled the sprawling U.S. tax code since Republican Ronald Reagan was president. The House measure is not as comprehensive as Reagan’s 1986 package, but it is more ambitious than anything since then. The path forward for the tax plan in the Senate, where Republicans have a narrow majority, is fraught with obstacles about concerns over the deficit, healthcare and the distribution of tax benefits. Republicans can lose no more than two Senate votes if Democrats remain united in opposition. Senate Republican tax-writers earlier this week made the risky decision of tying their plan to a repeal of the requirement for people to get healthcare insurance under former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act. That exposed the tax initiative to the same political forces that wrecked Republicans’ anti-Obamacare push earlier in July. The House bill, estimated to increase the federal deficit by nearly $1.5 trillion over 10 years, would consolidate individual and family tax brackets to four from seven and reduce the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent.  It also would scale back or end some popular tax deductions, including one for state and local income taxes, while preserving a capped deduction for property tax payments.  Democrats have pointed to analyses showing millions of Americans could end up with a tax hike because of eliminated deductions. Repealing or shrinking some deductions is a way to offset the revenue lost from tax cuts. “It’s a shameful piece of legislation, and the Republicans should know better,” House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi told lawmakers before the vote. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans that by increasing the deficit, the tax bill would imperil other important priorities such as military spending. Thirteen House Republicans opposed the bill, all but one from New York, New Jersey or California - states with high taxes where residents would feel the pinch from eliminating the deduction for state and local income taxes. “This fight is not over. I look forward to continuing negotiations to improve this proposal for my constituents,” said Republican Representative Lee Zeldin of New York, who voted against the bill. Investors have cheered the prospect of a tax overhaul. U.S. stocks rose and the dollar edged higher against a basket of major currencies on Thursday after the House vote. Brian Battle, director of trading at Performance Trust Capital Partners in Chicago, said stocks’ strong gains on the day were helped by the House vote. “It’s helping stocks now and the bond market’s turned around,” he said. “The tax plan isn’t a foregone conclusion, but it passed the lowest hurdle in the House. The even higher hurdle is to have something pass in the Senate.” Republicans have long promised tax cuts and see enacting them as critical to their prospects of retaining power in Washington in the November 2018 congressional elections, particularly after failing to meet their promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. But it will be a challenge in the 100-seat Senate, where Republicans have only a 52-48 majority. Senators Jeff Flake and James Lankford are among the four Republicans considering opposing the plan, Time reported. A Lankford spokesman said he was “eager to work with colleagues to pass tax reform.” Flake, who often clashes with Trump and has announced he will not seek re-election next year, told Reuters on Thursday he was “more worried about the fiscal problem” than other issues. Several other senators, including Ron Johnson and Susan Collins, who helped sink the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, have expressed concerns. Johnson announced his opposition because of what he said were unequal rates for small businesses and non-corporate enterprises known as “pass-throughs,” versus corporations. He is working with the White House to fix the issue, he told Reuters. Senator John McCain, a Republican who also voted against the healthcare overhaul effort this summer, and his colleagues Bob Corker and Lisa Murkowski, are also considered critical votes.  Nonpartisan congressional analysts say the provision to repeal the health insurance mandate in the Senate version would drive up premium costs and cause some 13 million Americans to lose coverage.  The Senate plan also sets individual tax rate cuts to expire while reductions for corporations are permanent.  If the full Senate approves its measure, it will have to be reconciled with the House version before legislation can be sent to Trump’s desk for his signature. Republican Representative Tom Cole said that should not be a problem. “There’s no issue here that can’t be ironed out and settled between us,” Cole told reporters.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A radio broadcaster accused U.S. Senator Al Franken on Thursday of touching her breasts while she slept and forcing a kiss on her in 2006 when he was still a comedian and the two were preparing to perform before U.S. troops in the Middle East. Anchor Leeann Tweeden related her experience in a first-person account on the website of Los Angeles station KABC amid outrage over numerous reports of sexual misconduct by powerful men from Hollywood to Capitol Hill.  Franken, a Democrat, issued an apology on Thursday. The Senate’s Democratic and Republican leaders called on the Ethics Committee to review the allegations and Franken said he would cooperate. Tweeden said Franken wrote a skit that included a kiss between the two and said he insisted upon rehearsing it, which she at first resisted. “He repeated that actors really need to rehearse everything and that we must practice the kiss. I said ‘OK’ so he would stop badgering me,” she wrote. “We did the line leading up to the kiss and then he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.” She said she pushed Franken away but felt disgusted and violated. Tweeden also said Franken groped her while she slept during their flight home on a military plane. “I felt violated all over again. Embarrassed. Belittled. Humiliated,” Tweeden wrote. “How dare anyone grab my breasts like this and think it’s funny?” She posted a photo taken at the time of Franken mugging for the camera with his hands above her breasts as she sat in the military aircraft wearing a flak jacket with eyes closed.   “I certainly don’t remember the rehearsal for the skit in the same way, but I send my sincerest apologies to Leeann. As to the photo, it was clearly intended to be funny but wasn’t. I shouldn’t have done it,” Franken said in a statement. Reuters was unable to independently verify Tweeden or Franken’s accounts.     She told reporters in a later press conference that she considered the kiss an assault but accepted his apology. “The apology? Sure, I accept it,” she said. “People make mistakes and of course he knew he made a mistake.” U.S. President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter, calling the photo “really bad.” “And to think that just last week he (Franken) was lecturing anyone who would listen about sexual harassment and respect for women,” Trump tweeted. Trump himself came under fire last year over alleged sexual misconduct after a decade-old outtake from his appearance on the television program “Access Hollywood” surfaced during the presidential campaign, in which Trump bragged about kissing and grabbing women without their consent. Trump later apologized for the “Access Hollywood” comments, which he called “locker room talk.” He told reporters last month that allegations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled at him before the election by several women were “made-up stuff.” Franken, in a longer statement issued after his first apology, was more contrite. “I don’t know what was in my head when I took that picture, and it doesn’t matter. There’s no excuse. I look at it now and I feel disgusted with myself. It isn’t funny. It’s completely inappropriate,” he said.  The USO, which sponsored the tour on which Franken and Tweeden traveled, said it was never aware of the incident. “This incident was never reported to the USO,” USO spokeswoman Ashley McLellan said in an email. “We have no knowledge of it. The report is deeply disturbing and does not reflect the values of the USO.”  Franken was a well-known American comedian before he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2008 as a Democrat from Minnesota. Sexual misconduct allegations have been lodged against several well-known men in the entertainment industry, and Roy Moore, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Alabama, has been accused of having sexual contact with teenage girls decades ago. Moore, 70, has denied the accusations and said he was the victim of a political witch hunt.  Trump on Thursday said Moore should step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true, a stance that puts him at odds with other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women making the accusations against the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded that Moore withdraw from the race ahead of the Dec. 12 vote. Lawmakers this week shared stories of women and men being propositioned and groped in the halls of the U.S. Capitol as Congress reviewed sexual harassment policies.   Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic leader Chuck Schumer agreed the Ethics Committee should investigate. Franken also called for an ethics investigation. “It appears that the Senate is looking into that, which they should, and we feel that is an appropriate action,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Thursday when asked about the allegations against Franken. Franken’s Democratic Senate colleagues Clare McCaskill and Kirsten Gillibrand both expressed deep concern about the allegations. “The behavior described is completely unacceptable. Comedy is no excuse for inappropriate conduct, and I believe there should be an ethics investigation,” McCaskill wrote on Twitter. Former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, asked about Alabama Senate candidate Moore, said reporters should be asking her instead about Franken and called up the photograph on her phone. “This is what you should be asking me about,” Palin said, as she talked to reporters in the U.S. Capitol, complaining about “double standards here.” She added Franken should leave the Senate if the account is true. Tweeden said she was inspired to tell her story by women members of Congress who spoke up against harassment this week. “I’m telling my story because there may be others,” she said.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump finds the sexual misconduct allegations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore “troubling” and thinks he should leave the race if they are true, the White House said on Thursday, as party leaders in Alabama stood by their nominee. Trump’s position did not go as far as other Republican leaders in Washington who have said they believe the women accusing the former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice and have demanded Moore withdraw from the race before the Dec. 12 vote. “The president believes that these allegations are very troubling and should be taken seriously,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said at a news briefing. “The president said in his statement earlier this week that if the allegations are true, then Roy Moore should step aside. He still firmly believes that,” she said. Asked if the president’s endorsement of Moore still stands, Sanders said Trump thinks Alabama voters should decide the winner of the race. Trump supported the Republican National Committee’s decision to withdraw resources from the contest, Sanders added. In the past week, multiple women have accused Moore of sexual improprieties or unwanted romantic advances they said occurred decades ago. Some of the women were teenagers at the time, and he was in his 30s. Moore, 70, has denied any wrongdoing. The married Christian conservative has said he is the victim of a witch hunt and has refused to drop out of the race. The allegations are “not only untrue but they have no evidence to support them,” Moore told a news conference on Thursday after about 20 supporters, including religious leaders, said they still backed his candidacy. In a tweet, he accused U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others of trying “to steal this election from the people of Alabama.” The Alabama Republican Party on Thursday said its 21-member steering committee would continue to support Moore. “He deserves to be presumed innocent of the accusations unless proven otherwise,” state party Chairwoman Terry Lathan said in a statement.  Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations by the women. Before the allegations surfaced, Moore was heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones in the special election next month. Moore scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange, who was appointed to fill the vacant seat after Jeff Sessions became U.S. attorney general earlier this year. Trump backed Strange in the primary but threw his support to Moore after Strange’s defeat. A poll released on Wednesday by the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm showed Jones surging to a 12-point lead since the accusations became public. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate. Republicans currently hold 52 seats in the 100-member upper chamber. ",Trump says U.S. Senate candidate Moore should leave race if allegations true
0,True,"November 17, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A U.S. congressional proposal that would eliminate income tax exemptions for certain airlines could affect major Gulf carriers, potentially worsening an international spat between U.S. airlines and their Middle East rivals. U.S. airlines have been petitioning the federal government for years to intervene in what they see as unfair competition by the three major Gulf carriers.    The proposal, tucked deep in the Senate tax-cut plan, calls for airlines headquartered in foreign countries to pay the U.S. incorporate tax rate if: 1) the carrier’s home country does not have an income tax treaty with the United States and 2) the carrier’s country of origin has fewer than two arrivals and departures, per week, operated by major U.S. airlines.  Airways, Emirates [EMIRA.UL] and Etihad Airways have for years been accused by U.S. competitors of being illegally subsidized by their governments. The Gulf carriers deny the accusation. They could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday. If the proposal passes, it could leave the Gulf carriers more vulnerable because their home countries – the United Arab Emirates and Qatar – do not have income tax treaties with the United States, according to the Internal Revenue Service website. A number of nations could possibly also be affected at a time when perceived discrepancies in U.S. trade agreements are facing a critical eye from U.S. corporations and the federal government.       The language in the Senate proposal sets the stage for a crackdown in tax leniency for these and other airlines. This would likely be well-received by American carriers, which have for years petitioned the U.S. government to intervene in the dispute. Under U.S. tax treaties, entities of foreign countries are either exempt or pay a reduced rate on their income, and vice versa for U.S. entities abroad. Reciprocity agreements, however, are less formal deals that fall short of an official accord, according to tax attorney Sam Brotman of Brotman Law. “Reciprocity agreements are usually with countries that are not necessarily 100 percent friendly with the U.S.” Brotman said on Thursday. “We’ll call it a handshake deal.” The bill’s wording stands to ramp up an already tense battle between U.S. airlines and Gulf carriers.  The addition was introduced by U.S. Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia. Delta Air Lines (DAL.N), one of the most vocal critics of Gulf carrier practices, is headquartered in Atlanta.  A spokeswoman for Isakson did not mention the Gulf airlines.    “This provision supports American jobs by providing a level playing field and mutual fairness in international passenger aviation,” Isakson spokeswoman Marie Gordon said in an email on Thursday.  “Foreign airlines should not receive preferential tax treatment if their countries choose not to open their markets to U.S. companies.” Delta declined to comment.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain warned President Donald Trump on Thursday against nominating any more defense industry insiders to top  Pentagon posts, as his committee questioned an executive from Lockheed Martin Corp about potential conflicts of interest. Concern over the close relationship between the Pentagon and arms manufacturers has existed for decades but appears to have  intensified under Trump. He has drawn scrutiny for filling posts throughout his government with high-ranking executives. The latest example was his naming this week of former pharmaceutical executive and lobbyist Alex Azar to become Health and Human Services secretary. McCain, chairman of the Senate’s armed services committee, said he was troubled by the number of Defense Department nominees drawn from the defense industry. He said he would oppose any more such nominations after John Rood, Trump’s pick for the Pentagon’s No. 3 job, who appeared before the committee on Thursday.  “From this point forward, I will not support any further nominees with that background,” McCain said in a statement. Rood ran into trouble during the hearing over his nomination to become undersecretary of defense for policy. As a Lockheed senior vice president, Rood’s job is to expand the company’s international business. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren pressed him to say if he would recuse himself from discussions with U.S. allies that could benefit Lockheed, the largest U.S. defense contractor with business in 70 countries. Rood said he did not intend to participate in talks about the sale of Lockheed products but did not give the “yes or no” reply sought by Warren, triggering a charged exchange with the committee. McCain joined Warren in demanding a direct answer and warned  Rood that otherwise, he was “going to have trouble getting through this committee.” McCain told Rood to submit his response in writing “because obviously you are ducking the answer here.”  The uproar came a day after the Senate confirmed Trump’s choice for Army secretary, Mark Esper, who was a top executive at Raytheon, another U.S. defense industry giant. He committed to recusing himself from matters tied to Raytheon. Trump’s Pentagon also has officials who previously worked at Boeing and Textron Systems. U.S. arms manufacturers like Raytheon, whose shares have risen more than 30 percent since December, are expected to benefit in the coming year from an increase in defense spending. The Pentagon says it has 38 unfilled positions for civilian defense leadership roles that require Senate confirmation, and at least 23 nominees whose names have already been submitted to the Senate.  It was unclear from McCain’s remarks whether he would oppose any of the already-announced nominees, although he seemed to be warning about future Pentagon picks.

The letter was published on the department’s web site. The inspector general launched an investigation of Zinke’s travels after reports emerged in September that he had used a private plane owned by oil executives. The probe was launched after the inspector general received numerous complaints about Zinke’s travels, including the use of three chartered flights. One of those flights, taken in June from Las Vegas to near Zinke’s hometown in Montana, cost taxpayers over $12,000, according to a Washington Post report. Kendall’s letter said her office had received full cooperation from all employees it had contacted, but that “we have found the documentation and adherence to departmental travel policies deficient and without proper management oversight and accountability.” It said many authorizations and vouchers required for Zinke’s travel have yet to be completed and processed. It requested documentation no later than Dec. 11 for the secretary and his wife, Lolita Zinke, when she accompanied him on government travel.  The letter also complained that the department’s travel review process failed to include proper documentation and accountability.  The Interior Department had no comment, but referred to a  letter, also published on the web site, from Bernhardt responding to Kendall. In a speech at conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation in September, Zinke denied inappropriate travel and said his travels were approved by “career employees” of the Interior Department’s ethics office. He called reports about his use of chartered private flights “a little B.S.” Bernhardt said in his letter that additional documents for the probe had been sent to the inspector general’s office earlier in the month. He said the department will work to provide available documentation for Zinke’s travel and said he appreciated recommendations by Kendall on travel procedures for the secretary’s immediate office. Bernhardt also said that Zinke and he had “inherited an organizational and operational mess” from the Obama administration. He said department travel procedures were the same under Obama. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin have also come under scrutiny over reports of expensive private plane use.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One thing is definitely going right for U.S. President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans who control Congress: they are steadily getting conservatives appointed as judges, advancing their long-held ambition of reshaping the federal judiciary. So concern among conservatives arose after Democrats swept to victory in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere this month, signaling potential trouble for Republicans in the November 2018 mid-term elections in which control over Congress is at stake. If the party’s slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, which reviews and confirms federal judicial nominees, is at risk, Republicans may need to move even more quickly on getting judges confirmed by the Senate for their lifetime posts, some legal experts said. “Obviously, who gets nominated and the pace of confirmations ... changes dramatically if the Senate were to flip back to the Democrats,” said John Malcolm, a former Justice Department lawyer and now an analyst at the Heritage Foundation conservative think tank in Washington. Republicans “should be paying particular attention to pushing through as many nominees as they can,” added Malcolm, also active in the Federalist Society, a conservative lawyers’ group whose members have frequently been tapped for judicial posts by Republican presidents.  Trump and congressional Republicans have not passed any major legislation since he took office in January despite controlling the White House and Congress. But after a slow start that had worried conservative activists, Republicans have made major headway on judicial appointments in recent weeks. The Senate has now voted to confirm 14 Trump judicial nominees, including Donald Coggins on Thursday as a district judge in South Carolina. That includes Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch, eight others on regional appeals courts ranking just below the Supreme Court and five on trial courts. Obama had only seven confirmed at this point in his presidency. Democrats, who accused Republicans of impeding nominations from Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama, have said Republicans are trying to ram Trump’s nominees through the Senate, including some they say lack basic qualifications. Conservative groups that just last month were criticizing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for the pace of confirmations are now applauding him. McConnell, in a move with little precedent in U.S. history, last year refused to act on Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court, paving the way for Trump to restore the high court’s conservative majority with Gorsuch’s appointment. “When the history books are written about the Trump administration, I believe perhaps the most long-lasting and significant legacy will be the men and women appointed and confirmed to the federal bench,” Republican Senator Ted Cruz said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Wednesday.  Trump has a unique opportunity to reshape the judiciary. He inherited more than 100 vacancies when he took office, twice the number Obama inherited. The number has since climbed above 160.  Trump generally has selected deeply conservative nominees, many in their 40s and 50s and able to serve for decades. He could name up to 30 percent of the federal bench in his first four-year term, said Leonard Leo, a Trump advisor on judicial nominations. Having a more conservative judiciary could be pivotal on legal disputes involving presidential powers, abortion, the death penalty, religious rights, gay rights, litigation involving corporations and other matters. The main impact of this infusion of conservative jurists will be to flip the ideological breakdown of several liberal-leaning federal appeals courts, said political scientist Sheldon Goldman, an expert in judicial selection at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.  Federal appeals courts, divided into 11 geographic regions plus two based in Washington, often have the final say in major legal disputes because the Supreme Court hears only a small number of cases annually.  During Wednesday’s Judiciary Committee hearing for six Trump judicial nominees, Democrats said Republicans were acting on too many too quickly, preventing proper questioning of the candidates. Trump’s appointees may be more reliably conservative than those of previous Republican presidents. Goldman said nearly all have a connection to the Federalist Society, providing a “very consistent ideological vetting process.” Leo, the society’s executive vice president, helped compile a shortlist of Supreme Court nominees for Trump that included Gorsuch. Judges will be a focus of the society’s national convention that started on Thursday in Washington, with Trump selections including Gorsuch due to appear. While Republican lawmakers have been divided over legislation on issues including taxes and healthcare, judicial nominees are an issue on which tend to agree. “Fixing Obamacare is no easy task,” said Carrie Severino, chief counsel of the Judicial Crisis Network conservative legal advocacy group, “whereas the president has done such an excellent job of choosing nominees that it’s a no-brainer.” ",Senate quickens pace of approving Trump judicial picks
0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Two more women came forward on Wednesday with allegations of sexual misconduct against Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore, one accusing him of groping her and the other of forcing a kiss on her when he was 30 and she was about 18. They are the sixth and seventh women to accuse Moore of sexual improprieties since his race for the Alabama Senate seat began. Most were teenagers at the time. Moore, 70, has denied the accusations and said he is the victim of a witch hunt. Gena Richardson told the Washington Post that Moore, then a 30-year-old attorney, had repeatedly asked her for a date in 1977 just before or after she turned 18. Richardson said she finally agreed and went to a movie with Moore, the Post said. In a dark parking lot at a mall in Gadsden, Alabama, Richardson said Moore gave her an unwanted, “forceful” kiss that scared her, the Post reported. Another woman, Tina Johnson, told AL.com, an Alabama news site, that Moore groped her while she was in his Alabama law office on legal business in 1991. Johnson, who was 28 at the time, said she visited Moore’s office with her mother, who had hired Moore in a custody case involving Johnson’s 12-year-old son. Johnson said Moore grabbed her buttocks as she left. “He didn’t pinch it, he grabbed it,” Johnson told AL.com. Reuters was unable to independently verify the allegations from either woman, and Moore’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Five other women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct or of dating them when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. National Republican Party leaders have responded with demands that he drop out of the Senate race. The Dec. 12 special election will fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was named U.S. attorney general last spring. Moore on Wednesday denied the allegations of the first five women to step forward. “We are in the process of investigating these false allegations to determine their origin and motivation,” he said in a statement. Moore also said he believed a message that one of the accusers, Beverly Young Nelson, said he had written in her high school yearbook had been tampered with. Nelson accused Moore of sexually assaulting her when she was 16 and he was in his 30s. Nelson displayed the yearbook message at a news conference in New York, where she made the allegations on Monday. Moore’s campaign on Wednesday demanded that Nelson turn over the yearbook to a neutral custodian so a handwriting expert could examine it. The Alabama state party’s leadership met on Wednesday night to discuss their stance and took no action, news media reported.  Republican leaders in Washington have asked Moore to withdraw from the race and said they are exploring write-in options for the election.  U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has spoken to President Donald Trump and others about the situation. Trump appeared at the White House on Wednesday but did not mention Moore. Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot. If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore.  Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice, had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. But a new poll on Wednesday, released by the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, had Jones surging to a 12-point lead since the allegations surfaced. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at wiping out the Republicans’ 52-48 Senate majority. Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans are working with news media to discredit him. The Washington Post first disclosed allegations by four women about their relationships with Moore when they were teenagers, ranging in age from 14 to 18. One of the women said he initiated sexual contact with her when she was 14 and Moore was in his 30s. ",Two more women accuse Senate candidate Moore of sexual misconduct

Many members of Congress, Democrats as well as some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans, have rejected Trump’s proposal to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent. Tillerson has embraced the plan, and imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency’s operations and deciding how to reorganize them. On Tuesday, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee both blasted the agency for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed organization. On Wednesday, Republican Senator John McCain, the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, the top Democrat on a Foreign Relations subcommittee overseeing State, delivered a letter to Tillerson asking him to begin consulting with lawmakers on decisions that have an impact on recruiting, retaining and staffing, removing a hiring freeze and resuming promotions.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate passed a $700 billion defense policy bill on Thursday, backing President Donald Trump’s call for a bigger, stronger military, but leaving unsettled how to fund the massive spending increase amid a Republican-led push to cut taxes. The Senate passed by voice vote the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which authorizes the level of defense spending and sets policies controlling how the money is spent. The measure, passed by the House of Representatives on Tuesday [L1N1NK2OP], next goes to the White House for Trump’s signature. Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the House and Senate and he is expected to sign the bill. But the funding may never come to fruition. The 2018 NDAA defies spending caps set in the 2011 Budget Control Act, passed to help control the budget deficit, and there is no clear plan from Congress on how to provide more money for the Pentagon. The Senate backed the NDAA on the same day Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a sweeping tax bill, with no support from Democrats, which is expected to increase the federal deficit by nearly $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Senate Republicans are working on their own version of the measure. The 2018 NDAA authorizes $634 billion in base defense spending, for such things as buying weapons and paying the troops, well above the $549 billion allowed under the “sequestration” controls set in the Budget Control Act. It also includes about $66 billion in special war funding, which is exempt from the sequestration cap. The NDAA passed this week is a compromise reached by House and Senate negotiators between separate versions of the bill approved in the chambers earlier this year. A budget fight is expected, however, because Senate Democrats may not agree to big increases in funds for the military if spending caps on non-defense programs are not also eased. While Senate rules would allow Republicans to pass their tax bill without any Democratic votes, their Senate majority of 52-48 is so small that most legislation, including a change in the sequestration rules, would require Democratic votes.

0,True,"October 25, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Communications Commission wants to rollback landmark media ownership regulations that prohibit owning a television station and newspaper in the same market and making it easier to acquire additional TV or radio stations, Chairman Ajit Pai said on Wednesday. If approved at the FCC’s November meeting, the move would be a win for newspapers and broadcasters that have pushed for the change for decades, but was criticized by Democrats who said it could usher in a new era of media consolidation. The FCC in 1975 banned cross-ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market, unless it granted a waiver, to ensure a diversity of opinions. The rule was made before the explosion of internet and cable news and Republican President Donald Trump and Pai have vowed to reduce government regulation. “We must stop the federal government from intervening in the news business,” Pai told a congressional panel, noting that many newspapers have closed and many radio and TV stations are struggling. Pai moved earlier this year to make it easier for some companies to own a larger number of local stations.  Pai said the marketplace no longer justifies the rules, citing Facebook Inc (FB.O) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) dominance of internet advertising. “Online competition for the collection and distribution of news is greater than ever. And just two internet companies claim 100 percent of recent online advertising growth; indeed, their digital ad revenue this year alone will be greater than the market cap of the entire broadcasting industry,” Pai said. FCC Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, a Democrat, said at the hearing Wednesday the move would lead to further consolidation in the media business and should be opposed. There are three Republicans and two Democrats on the panel. Pai also proposes to make it easier for companies to own multiple TV and radio stations in the same market and he would allow two local stations among the top four in a market to petition the FCC to merge. The Pew Research Center said in June total weekday circulation for U.S. daily newspapers fell 8 percent in 2016, marking the 28th consecutive year of declines, while Sunday circulation declined to 38 million, the lowest levels since 1945. Newspaper ad revenue in 2016 fell to $18 billion, down from $49 billion in 2006. News Media Alliance Chief Executive David Chavern said newspapers need economies of scale to complete. He praised Pai’s move, saying the current rules “do not make sense, particularly when newspapers compete with countless sources of news and information every day.” The National Association of Broadcasters said it backs Pai’s plan, noting that policymakers have approved numerous “mega-mergers” among phone, cable and satellite programmers “while at the same time blocking broadcast/newspaper or radio/TV combinations in single markets.” The group added “this nonsensical regulatory approach has harmed the economic underpinning of newspapers, reduced local journalism jobs, and punished free and local broadcasters at the expense of our pay TV and radio competitors.” Free Press, an advocacy group, said the proposal would make it easier for Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc (SBGI.O) to complete its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co (TRCO.N) with fewer divestitures. The “disastrous proposal is tailor-made for Sinclair and other giant broadcast chains that push often slanted or cookie-cutter content over the public airwaves,” the group said.

Page, an oil industry consultant with numerous contacts in Russia, told Reuters in a text message that he delivered the documents to the Senate and House intelligence committees. “Just dropped irrelevant and unnecessary documents off for the Witch Hunt,” Page said in his text. “On to bigger and better things now.” Page delivered the documents two weeks after acknowledging in an appearance before the House panel that he had not provided all relevant documents sought by a subpoena, including emails in which he and another former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, were included. According to a transcript of his testimony released last week, Page said that he had not turned over the emails because he assumed that the committee “most likely would have received them from others already.” He agreed to submit them. Under subsequent questioning, Page first cited his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as a reason for withholding documents relevant to the committee subpoena. He then said that, “Nothing would directly incriminate me,” but added that he was concerned about discrepancies between documents he withheld and materials collected by a government eavesdropping operation under a secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant.  Papadopoulos pleaded guilty last month to a charge of lying to the FBI about his efforts to arrange a meeting during the 2016 campaign between then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Papadopolous also agreed to cooperate with the investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. Russia denies interfering in the 2016 campaign. Trump denies there was any collusion between his campaign and what U.S. intelligence agencies charge was a Russian influence operation that was intended to sway the vote to Trump over his Democratic challenger, Hillary Clinton.

(Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday there could be an opportunity for talks between North Korea and the United States if Pyongyang stopped testing and developing its nuclear and missile programs. “So long as they stop testing, stop developing, they don’t export their weapons, there would be opportunity for talks,” Mattis told reporters on a military plane. While Washington has said that all options, including military, are on the table in dealing with North Korea, it has stressed its preference is for a diplomatic solution. Visiting Seoul last week, U.S. President Donald Trump warned North Korea he was prepared to use the full range of American military power to stop any attack, but also urged Pyongyang to “make a deal.”  Trump, who had previously called negotiations with North Korea a waste of time, has offered no clear path to talks. Pyongyang has made clear it has little interest in negotiations, at least until it has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. The last North Korean missile test was carried out almost two months ago, but U.S. officials say they have seen no signs that Pyongyang has stopped development. Mattis said the U.S. military was closely watching why there had been no missile launches recently, but declined to give potential reasons for it.  There are concerns in South Korea that any potential U.S. strikes against North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs could provoke devastating North Korean retaliation against South Korea. Earlier this week, a senior South Korean official said Trump should “under no circumstances” take military action against North Korea without the consent of the government in Seoul. In Colorado, Mattis will visit the U.S. Northern Command and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), which are responsible for homeland defense, including tracking and potentially intercepting North Korean missiles.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator Susan Collins is back in the spotlight as a crucial swing vote in the U.S. Senate as she raises questions about how combining a Republican tax-cut plan with a partial repeal of Obamacare will affect middle-class Americans.  A day after Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to link the two issues in a risky strategy, Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, was citing data that she called worrisome, casting new doubts over the tax plan’s outlook. She told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday that her staff’s research showed pairing tax cuts with an effective repeal of the individual mandate of Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act (ACA), could be a mistake. “I have data that demonstrates for certain middle-income individuals and couples, who do not qualify for subsidies under the ACA ... that the premium increase will outweigh the tax cut that they get,” she said. “I suspected this, based on what I know about insurance markets, but now I have the actual data.” Collins was one of a handful of Republicans who voted in July to block a broader Republican attempt to dismantle Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. The failure of the final repeal effort, in which Collins was joined in opposition by fellow Republicans John McCain and Lisa Murkowski, was a stinging defeat for President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders eager to fulfill their campaign promise to scrap Obamacare. Collins, 64, a senator since 1997, decided last month against running for governor of Maine in favor of staying in the Senate, where her status as a centrist Republican willing to work with Democrats has made her one of the most influential members of Congress. That has become especially obvious in recent months. After her role in halting Obamacare repeal efforts during the summer, she said in September she would oppose another Republican healthcare overhaul, known as Cassidy-Graham, leaving it short of the votes needed to pass. She cited concerns about its proposed cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor. Collins, along with McCain, Murkowski and Senator Ron Johnson, has emerged in the past 24 hours as pivotal to winning Senate approval of the tax-cut plan, which is backed by the president and is critical to the party’s 2018 electoral prospects as they seek their first major legislative win since Trump took office in January. In an unexpected move, McConnell on Tuesday inserted a proposed individual mandate repeal in the Senate tax plan. The mandate, long opposed by Republicans, requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a federal fine. The rule is meant to ensure enough young, healthy people are in Obamacare to offset the costs of covering sicker and older people. Repealing the mandate, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week, would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027 and raise average Obamacare marketplace insurance policy premiums by about 10 percent annually over the next decade. That premium increase could cancel out any tax-cut gains some middle-class Americans stand to make under the Senate tax plan, according to the research cited by Collins, who oversaw Maine’s Bureau of Insurance before she came to the Senate. Collins has not taken a stand on the tax plan. “I am going to wait and evaluate what is in the bill,” she said. “I do believe our taxes need to be overhauled. ... I just don’t know why we had to complicate it by bringing up the ACA.” Johnson, in a statement on Wednesday, said: “Neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current version.” The Wisconsin lawmaker added he would work with his Republican colleagues to produce better legislation. Murkowski, when asked on Wednesday if she backed the tax-cut plan with a mandate repeal, said she was focused on opening Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil drilling, a key goal for the Alaska lawmaker. A committee that Murkowski chairs on Wednesday passed a bill to open ANWR to drilling, which is now expected to be attached to the tax legislation.

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Senate Republican tax plan that would repeal the Obamacare mandate and give permanent tax cuts only to U.S. corporations drew fire from two Republican lawmakers on Wednesday in what could be a sign of trouble for the sweeping measure.  Republican Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said he would not support the current Senator proposal, or a separate tax bill being debated in the House of Representatives, because he believes they unfairly benefit corporations over other kinds of enterprises, including small businesses. Senator Susan Collins, one of three Republicans who opposed a Republican Obamacare repeal effort earlier this year, warned that some middle-income taxpayers could see tax cuts wiped out by higher health insurance premiums if the repeal of the Affordable Care Act’s mandate goes through.   Their views could signal problems for Senate Republicans, who want to pass tax legislation by December but can afford to lose no more than two votes from their ranks because they have only a 52-48 majority in the Senate. Democrats have called the Republican tax plans a giveaway to the rich and corporations. “Neither the House nor Senate bill provide fair treatment, so I do not support either in their current version,” Johnson said in a statement, adding he would still work with his Republican colleagues to produce better legislation. Senate Republicans produced a new plan late on Tuesday that would guarantee permanent tax cuts for corporations but only temporarily lower tax bills for individuals and small businesses, while tying the overall package to an effective repeal of a key part of Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Exposing the tax-cut initiative to the same political risks that wrecked a mid-2017 anti-Obamacare push by Republicans, Senate tax committee chief Orrin Hatch unveiled an amendment that he defended as helpful to the middle class. Collins, a Maine Republican, told reporters that adding the mandate repeal was a mistake. “This is going to be difficult and I just don’t know why we had to complicate it by bringing up the ACA,” she said. Several moderate Republicans including Collins and John McCain have not said if they support the tax plan. The new Republican plan, Hatch said at a committee meeting, would expand the child tax credit and slightly reduce some middle-class tax rates. Taken together, those changes “will let us channel even more tax relief to the middle class,” he said. But those changes would be temporary, while a deep cut in the corporate tax rate would be permanent under Hatch’s plan, which was widely expected to become the main vehicle for Republicans efforts to revamp the tax code before year end. The effort is seen by Republicans as critical to their prospects of retaining power in Washington in the November 2018 congressional elections. So far, Republicans and President Donald Trump have no major legislative victories from 2017 to show voters despite controlling the White House and Congress.  They are hoping the tax cut will fix that problem and have made progress in recent days while Trump toured Asian capitals. He returned late on Tuesday and was scheduled to meet with lawmakers on Thursday. The House began debating its tax bill on Wednesday, with a full vote expected on Thursday. The Senate and House tax plans must eventually be reconciled and merged into a final plan that can pass both chambers before it goes to Trump to sign into law.  By including an effective repeal of Obamacare’s individual mandate, Senate Republicans likely ended any possibility of gaining support from Democrats. “This is not just another garden variety attack on the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. This is repeal of that law,” said Senator Ron Wyden, the finance committee’s top Democrat. He blasted Republicans for setting a “double standard” by guaranteeing permanent tax cuts only for corporations. The individual mandate clause of Obamacare requires healthy younger people to buy insurance or pay a federal penalty. The aim is to hold down coverage costs for those sick or older. By repealing that penalty, Republicans would raise more than $318 billion over a decade to pay for tax cuts, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan unit of Congress. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office separately estimated last week that repealing the mandate would increase the number of uninsured Americans by 13 million by 2027.    Trump backed the inclusion of the mandate repeal in the tax bill, as do Republican conservatives in the Senate and House. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNBC on Wednesday that while the House tax plan did not repeal the mandate, Republicans in that chamber would likely approve a final measure hammered out with the Senate that included it. Hatch’s Senate plan would also expand access to deductions for “pass-through” businesses and increase the child tax credit to $2,000 from the earlier proposed $1,650. But those benefits would expire at the end of 2025. The changes would still allow the measure to comply with a deficit requirement that must be met if Senate Republicans are to pass the legislation with a simple majority. The Senate tax plan is required to add no more than $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the federal deficit and national debt. Otherwise, Senate Republicans would need 60 votes.

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - State and local governments could suffer hits to revenue collections under the tax reform bills being considered in the U.S. Senate and House because of the potential loss of a federal subsidy applied to bond issues and because a proposed increase in the standard taypayer deductions would affect some states. These additional risks to state and local governments are coming to light as lawmakers and experts sift through the bills before the two chambers. State and local governments have already been grappling with the potential revenue-raising risks of provisions in the two bills that would eliminate or cap taxpayer deductions of state and local income, sales and property taxes from their federal tax bills. Analysts on Wednesday said that the U.S. House of Representatives bill, which was unveiled Nov. 2, could knock out a federal subsidy applied to billions of dollars of bonds sold by states and local governments in the aftermath of the Great Recession. The threat to the subsidy was disclosed in correspondence this week between the Congressional Budget Office and Representative Steny Hoyer, a Democrat who was seeking more details about the effects of the House tax bill.  Build America Bonds (BABs) were created under an economic stimulus law that allowed municipal issuers to sell for a limited time taxable debt with the federal government contributing 35 percent of interest costs. Between April 2009 and the end of 2010, $181.5 billion of BABs were sold in 2,351 issues.  The future federal subsidy on the $13.5 billion of BABs sold by California, the biggest issuer of the debt, totals $6.7 billion, according to the state treasurer’s office. “Rather than follow through on an earlier Congressional commitment to reimburse states for the costs of issuing Build America Bonds, which were used to jumpstart our Great-Recession-decimated economy, Congress instead wants to allow our nation’s wealthiest tycoons to feed deeper at the public trough,” California Treasurer John Chiang said in a statement. “As a result California taxpayers will be on the hook for $6.7 billion that could otherwise be used for education, public safety, and other vital public programs,” he added. The U.S. government’s payment on BABs became subject to federal across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, resulting in subsidy cuts that ranged from 8.7 percent in 2013 to 6.6 percent in the current fiscal year, according to the Internal Revenue Service. The Congressional Budget Office said this week that the estimated $1.5 trillion increase over 10 years in the federal budget deficit under the House tax bill would, in fiscal 2018, wipe out funding for many programs subject to sequestration under federal law. That would leave BABs issuers without a federal subsidy, according to Bill Daly, governmental affairs director for the National Association of Bond Lawyers. But Congress has the ability to protect the BABs’ subsidy. “Seems to us it’s entirely a budgeting problem and all the Congress has to do is say the deficit will not be subject to sequestration,” said Philip Fischer, municipal research strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  So far in 2017, BABs have notched total returns of 7.17 percent, outpacing other fixed-income classes including U.S. Treasuries and corporate bonds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. In addition, big increases in federal standard deductions in both the House and Senate bills could cause revenue problems for eight states unless they take preemptive legislative action. For Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, Missouri, North Dakota, South Carolina, Utah and Vermont a rise in the federal deduction would automatically increase the state deduction, decreasing tax collections, according to Ron Alt, senior manager of research at the Federation of Tax Administrators.

0,True,"November 16, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers are pressing forward with an investigation into the 2010 sale of a Canadian uranium company, which owned 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies, to a Russian government firm, despite five congressional inquiries having found no evidence of wrongdoing. Copies of letters by the heads of two U.S. House of Representatives committees released on Wednesday showed they were seeking documents and other material on the deal from the FBI, the Treasury and State Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The letters set a deadline of Nov. 30. Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, and Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, opened investigations on Oct. 24 into the agreement struck during the previous administration of President Barack Obama, a Democrat. The committees “have questions ... about the review and approval” of the sale of Uranium One - which owned 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies - by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, or CFIUS, according to the letters. The committees also want to know if the FBI “had evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering,” the letters said. Although Hillary Clinton was not mentioned by name, the letters reflect unsubstantiated allegations by U.S. President Donald Trump, Republican lawmakers, and right-wing media that the 2016 Democratic nominee masterminded the approval of the sale in return for donations to the Clinton Foundation. Five committees in the U.S. House and Senate found no evidence that Clinton was behind the CFIUS’ approval of the deal, according to congressional records. In Twitter posts, Trump has called for an investigation of the sale, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions said on Tuesday he is evaluating whether to appoint a special counsel.  Democrats and other critics say the allegations are baseless, and that Trump and his supporters are fanning them to distract attention from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into whether there was any collusion between the Trump election campaign and Russia. While Clinton was Secretary of State at the time of the sale, her department has only one of nine votes on CFIUS, which is chaired by the Treasury Department and approved the sale unanimously. In addition, the State Department CFIUS seat was occupied not by her, but by Jose Fernandez, then-assistant secretary for economic, energy, and business affairs, who has said Clinton played no role in the decision. The sale also was approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Obama. In a related development, Representative Elijah Cummings, the top oversight committee Democrat, objected on Wednesday to the Republicans’ refusal to give Democrats access to an unidentified FBI informant whom Republican lawmakers say has new evidence in the case.  In a letter to Gowdy, Cummings said Republican lawmaker Ron DeSantis told Fox News on Oct. 22 that he thought the informant could link the approval of the Uranium One sale to “millions of dollars” that “sources connected to Uranium One” donated to the Clinton Foundation.

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior U.S. senators asked Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Wednesday to explain “questionable management practices” at his department that they believe are weakening the country’s diplomatic power, adding to a chorus of concern in Congress. Republican Senator John McCain and Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen delivered a letter to Tillerson asking him to begin consulting with lawmakers on decisions that have an impact on recruiting, retaining and staffing the State Department, removing a hiring freeze and resuming promotions. McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee and Shaheen is the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s subcommittee on State Department management. “While we support reasonable steps to improve the efficiency of the State Department, such efforts must be fully transparent, with the objective of enhancing, not diminishing, American diplomacy,” the senators wrote. They said declining morale, recruitment and retention of staff, a lack of experienced leadership and reports that diplomacy is becoming less effective “paint a disturbing picture.” Many members of Congress, Democrats as well as some of President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans, have rejected Trump’s proposal to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent. Tillerson has embraced the plan, and imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency’s operations and deciding how to reorganize them. On Tuesday, the Republican chairman and top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee both blasted the agency for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed organization. The panel’s top Democrat, Senator Ben Cardin, reiterated his concerns on Wednesday. “Our national security is being jeopardized by the employment and career decisions being made at the State Department,” he told reporters. It was not immediately clear how lawmakers could press the administration to change its policies, especially because Trump’s fellow Republicans, most of whom vote consistently with the president, hold majorities in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. A State Department representative said the department had received the letter and would “appropriately respond.” Tillerson has said his reorganization plan aimed to increase efficiency and to cut costs, with a target of saving at least 10 percent, or about $5 billion, over the next five years from fiscal-year 2017 levels.  Cardin said the impact of disorganization at the State Department was being felt internationally. “I could mention almost every place in the world,” he said.

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Venture capitalists and startup executives, who had mounted a campaign against a proposal to change how the federal government taxes stock options, expressed relief on Wednesday after the U.S. Senate dropped the measure from its tax overhaul plan. The Senate tax bill had proposed taxing employee stock options, a crucial part of compensation at technology startups, as they vest. Options generally vest over a four-year period. The result would have been annual tax bills for startup employees that soared into the tens of thousands of dollars, warned startup founders and employees. Startup options give employees the right to purchase shares in the future and are illiquid, meaning employees cannot spend or save their options. The Senate removed that provision late Tuesday night following heavy lobbying from the National Venture Capital Association, the industry trade group, and an outpouring of opposition from Silicon Valley venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. They predicted the demise of the startup industry should the tax become law. “The entrepreneurial ecosystem can breathe a sigh of relief,” said Bobby Franklin, president and chief executive of the trade association. More than 600 startups, investors and executives from companies such as Uber, Airbnb and Stripe signed a letter Tuesday to Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, urging him to remove the provision. “This shift would have profound negative consequences for technology startups by, among other things, undermining their ability to compete with large incumbents for employees,” they wrote in the letter, organized by technology advocacy group Engine. A spokesman for Hatch did not respond to a request for comment. The current tax code taxes employees only when they exercise their options. The Senate proposal would have required employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of stock options even before cashing them in. The National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) was also successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the original House tax reform bill. “We don’t anticipate it coming back up again,” said Ben Veghte, spokesman for the NVCA. In the new version of the Senate bill, the finance committee also added language that would enable startup employees to defer for five years their stock options tax bill if they reach the deadline to exercise them but the company is still private and shares do not trade on the public markets. Venky Ganesan, managing director of Menlo Ventures, called the changes “consistent with economic growth and job creation.” ",Senate drops proposal to change taxes on startup stock options

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The internal watchdog at the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday he hopes to complete his review by early spring into whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation erred when it announced it was reopening its investigation into Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton’s emails ahead of the 2016 presidential election. “We have interviewed dozens of people. We are not at the 100 level yet, but we’re in the dozens range. We’ve reviewed about 1.2 million records in the course of the investigation,” Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz said, in testimony before a U.S. House of Representatives panel.  “We are aiming to release the report in late winter/early spring, so hopefully in that March-April time period.”  After a deluge of congressional requests, Horowitz’s office earlier this year announced it would review the pre-election decision-making at the FBI. At the heart of the review is whether former FBI Director James Comey improperly made a series of public statements about the status of the bureau’s investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email server for official correspondence while she was Secretary of State. Comey, who was fired in May by U.S. President Donald Trump, had also led an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. The FBI does not typically discuss its investigations publicly. In the case of Clinton, however, Comey decided in July 2016 to hold a press conference and explain why the FBI had declined to refer Clinton for prosecution. He said at the time her actions were careless, but did not rise to criminal behavior. Comey in October 2016 sent Congress a letter saying the FBI needed to re-open its investigation after it uncovered new emails on the computer of former Representative Anthony Weiner, who had been married to one Clinton’s top aides. Then on Nov. 6, 2016 - two days before the presidential election - Comey said the FBI had not uncovered any new evidence. Comey’s various public disclosures stirred a lot of controversy with some questioning whether he had violated the Hatch Act, which bars government employees from interfering with U.S. elections.  Republicans have also complained about why former U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch did not recuse herself from the matter after it was revealed she had met with former President Bill Clinton on board a plane while the investigation was still ongoing. The issues have recently prompted a handful of committees in the Republican-led U.S. Congress to open their own reviews into the same set of facts being probed by Horowitz’s office.

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration publicly released on Wednesday its rules for deciding whether to disclose cyber security flaws or keep them secret, in an effort to bring more transparency to a process that has long been cloaked in mystery. The move is an attempt by the U.S. government to address criticism that it too often jeopardizes internet security by stockpiling the cyber vulnerabilities it detects in order to preserve its ability to launch its own attacks on computer systems. The revised rules, published on whitehouse.gov, are intended to shed light on the process for how various federal agencies weigh the costs of keeping a flaw secret, said Rob Joyce, the White House cyber security coordinator. Speaking at an Aspen Institute event in Washington, Joyce said the rules were the “most sophisticated” in the world and that they set the United States apart from most other nations.  Private companies, he said, “are not getting tips from China, Russia, North Korea, Iran” about flaws in their technology. Under former President Barack Obama, the U.S. government created an inter-agency review, known as the Vulnerabilities Equities Process, to determine what to do with flaws unearthed primarily by intelligence agencies such as the National Security Agency (NSA).  The process is designed to balance law enforcement and U.S. intelligence desires to hack into devices with the need to warn manufacturers so that they can patch holes before criminals and other hackers take advantage of them. The new Trump administration charter on the process explains how it functions and names the agencies involved in the vulnerability reviews. They include intelligence agencies in addition to several civilian departments, including the Departments of Commerce, Treasury, Energy and State. The NSA is listed as the “executive secretariat” of the inter-agency group, tasked with coordinating debate over flaws submitted by the various agencies if there is disagreement about whether to disclose them. If disagreements are not reconciled the group will vote on whether to disclose or retain the flaw. The rules also require an annual report, portions of which will be made public, that provides metrics about the amount of flaws discovered, retained and disclosed.  Decisions to retain vulnerabilities must be reconsidered every year, according to the charter.    The publication of the charter is “a major improvement,” said Ari Scwhartz, coordinator of the Coalition for Cybersecurity Policy and Law and a former Obama administration cyber official. The Obama administration sought to release a similar document before the end of last year but ran out of time, Schwartz said. Some security experts have long criticized the process as overly secretive and too often erring against disclosure.  Joyce said on Wednesday more than 90 percent of flaws are ultimately disclosed, though some critics say they are not shared quickly enough and that the most severe flaws are too often stockpiled. The criticism grew earlier this year when a global ransomware attack known as WannaCry infected computers in at least 150 countries, knocking hospitals offline and disrupting services at factories. The attack was made possible because of a flaw in Microsoft’s Windows software that the NSA had used to build a hacking tool for its own use.  But in a breach U.S. investigators are still working to understand, that tool and others ended up in the hands of a mysterious group called the Shadow Brokers, which then published them online. Suspected North Korean hackers spotted the Windows flaw and repurposed it to unleash the WannaCry attack, according to cyber experts. North Korea has routinely denied involvement in cyber attacks against other countries. Asked about the WannaCry attack, Joyce declined to say whether the Windows flaw detected by the NSA went through the vulnerability review process.

0,True,"November 15, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A report to the U.S. Congress released on Wednesday accused Chinese state media entities of involvement in spying and propaganda and said their staff in the United States should be required to register as foreign agents. The annual report of the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission said that while China had tightened restrictions on domestic and foreign media, Chinese state media had rapidly expanded overseas. The commission, created by Congress in 2000 to monitor national security implications of U.S.-China trade relations, said China’s state media expansion was part of a broader effort to exert greater control over how China is depicted globally, as well as to gather information. The report highlighted the rapid growth of the Xinhua news agency and noted that it had offices at the United Nations in New York, Washington, Chicago, Los Angeles, Houston and San Francisco. “Xinhua serves some of the functions of an intelligence agency by gathering information and producing classified reports for the Chinese leadership on both domestic and international events,” the report said. It quoted testimony to the commission by the U.S. Government-funded rights organization, Freedom House, as saying it was a “loophole” that individuals working for Xinhua and China’s People’s Daily newspaper were not covered by the Foreign Agents Registration Act. FARA, first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War Two  to combat German propaganda efforts, requires foreign governments, political parties and lobbyists they hire in the United States to register with the Department of Justice.  The China Daily, an English-language newspaper owned by China’s government and ruling Communist Party, is already registered under FARA but only its top executives are required to individually disclose working for the publication. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers is working to overhaul FARA after Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, and a business associate were indicted for failing to register under the law.  The reform, backed by powerful Senate Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley, could provide an opportunity for Congress to act on the commission recommendations.  On Monday, the Kremlin-backed television station RT America registered under FARA after U.S. intelligence agencies in a report in January called it a “state-run propaganda machine” that contributed to the Kremlin’s campaign to interfere with last year’s U.S. presidential election. Under the act, RT will be required to disclose financial information. Moscow has said it views the action against RT as an unfriendly act.

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans on Tuesday linked repealing a key component of Obamacare to their ambitious tax-cut plan, raising new political risks and uncertainties for the tax measure that financial markets have been monitoring closely for months. In comments that infuriated Democrats and left some senior Republicans unsure what comes next, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell told reporters: “We’re optimistic that inserting the individual mandate repeal would be helpful and that’s obviously the view of the Senate Finance Committee Republicans as well.” The finance panel, which had been in session for two days, abruptly adjourned on Tuesday as Democrats slammed the Republicans’ handling of their tax proposals, for which formal legislative language has still not been unveiled. Ron Wyden, the committee’s top Democrat, demanded more time for Democrats to discuss the issue “because we were never told that healthcare was going to be part of it and this just flew in literally out of nowhere in the last 20 minutes.” Tying Obamacare to the tax program introduces new risks for the Republicans and for President Donald Trump. Together, they have yet to score a major legislative win since Trump took power in January, even with control of Congress and the White House. The president, who has struggled in his relations with Congress, suggested in a tweet on Monday that the mandate repeal should be added to the tax plan, following up on a similar Nov. 3 tweet. No final decision on such a move was made at the Senate Republicans’ weekly luncheon, Senator Susan Collins told reporters afterward. She played a key role in July’s collapse of a years-long push by fellow Republicans to gut Obamacare, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act. “I personally think that it complicates tax reform to put the repeal of the individual mandate in there,” Collins said. Asked if she would back the tax bill if a mandate repeal were added, she said: “I’m going to wait and see.” Senator John McCain, who was also central to his party’s failed Obamacare repeal earlier this year, was non-committal on putting the mandate repeal in the tax plan, saying: “I want to see the whole bill before I decide.” The Senate and House of Representatives are developing separate tax-cut packages they plan to reconcile eventually and send to Trump’s desk for enactment into law, an outcome Republicans are eager to achieve so they can face U.S. voters next year with at least one major legislative achievement. House Speaker Paul Ryan, asked why the repeal of the Obamacare mandate was not in the House version of the tax proposal, told Fox News on Tuesday: “We didn’t want to complicate tax reform, make it harder than it otherwise would be.” The House had already agreed to eliminate the mandate in a healthcare bill it passed in May, he noted, adding: “We want to see the Senate go first and see if they can get that done and then we’ll discuss whether or not it’s included at the end.” The Trump administration strongly supports the House version of the tax legislation, saying its passage would be “an important first step in achieving comprehensive tax reform,” the White House said in a statement on Tuesday.      U.S. financial markets have been watching closely, with U.S. stocks rallying in recent months, partly on hopes of business tax cuts. They showed little reaction to Tuesday’s developments. The individual mandate requires Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty to Washington, a provision that Republicans have long opposed as government overreach. But the mandate plays a critical role in Obamacare by requiring young, healthy people, who might otherwise go without coverage, to purchase insurance and help offset the costs of covering sicker and older Americans. Underscoring the devastating consequences for Obamacare if the mandate were repealed, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said last week that such a change would increase the number of Americans without health insurance by 13 million by 2027. The CBO added that  mandate repeal would raise the average insurance policy premiums in the Obamacare marketplaces by about 10 percent annually over the next decade. Repealing the mandate would also lower the federal deficit by $338 billion over the same time period, the CBO said, a finding that several Republican senators said influenced the move. Eliminating the individual mandate would lower the number of Americans with health insurance, meaning the federal government would spend less on subsidizing coverage for lower- and middle-income people, making that money available to pay for tax cuts. Neither the Senate nor the House tax plans now includes repealing the mandate. But both plan would add about $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the federal deficit and the national debt, which now exceeds $20 trillion. Congressional Republicans hope to pass tax legislation by the end of the year and are moving fast, despite uncertainties. They hold only a razor-thin 52-48 majority in the Senate. If Democrats remain united in opposition, Republicans could afford to lose no more than two senators from within their own ranks and still secure passage of tax legislation. Democrats have dismissed the Republican plans as deficit-expanding giveaways to corporations and the wealthy. Representative Lloyd Doggett, a senior member of the House tax committee, said in a statement that the House tax bill was “just a way to curry favor with Washington special interests – awarding tax windfalls to large multinational corporations and the fortunate few that sit way atop the economic ladder.” ",Senate Republicans tie tax plan to repeal of key Obamacare mandate
0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday that he wanted to work with the White House to explore ways to keep embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore from taking office if he wins a special election in Alabama. Speaking to reporters at the U.S. Capitol, McConnell said he had been in contact with President Donald Trump and others about sexual misconduct allegations against Moore. “He’s obviously not fit to be in the United States Senate,” McConnell said, “and we’ve looked at all the options to try and prevent that from happening.” Five women have accused Moore of sexual misconduct stemming from when he was in his 30s and they were teenagers. Moore, now 70, has denied the allegations.  Trump returns to Washington on Tuesday evening from a 12-day trip to Asia, and McConnell said he planned to discuss Moore’s situation with the president. Both are Republicans.  McConnell said he had also spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and White House Chief of Staff John Kelly about Moore. Trump supported Moore’s opponent, Luther Strange, in the Republican primary but threw his support to Moore after Strange was defeated. McConnell said Republicans were still considering having a candidate launch a write-in campaign against Moore for the Dec. 12 special election. Speculation has centered on Strange and the current U.S. attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as possibilities. McConnell said later in the day that Sessions, who left the Senate seat to become attorney general, would be a plausible write-in candidate. “He fits the mold of somebody who might be able to pull off a write-in,” the majority leader said during a forum on the economy.  Before the allegations surfaced, Moore, a Christian conservative and former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice,  had been heavily favored to defeat Democrat Doug Jones, a former U.S. attorney. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate. Under state law, Moore cannot be removed from the ballot. “Obviously this close to the election, it’s a very complicated matter,” McConnell said earlier. Moore has suggested that McConnell and other establishment Republicans were working in tandem with news media to discredit him.  After McConnell’s remarks, Moore responded by tweeting: “The good people of Alabama, not the Washington elite who wallow in the swamp, will decide this election!” McConnell urged Moore on Monday to leave the race, while Senator Cory Gardner, who chairs the Republican Party’s Senate campaign arm, suggested the Senate should expel Moore should he continue campaigning and win.  The Republican National Committee has withdrawn its support for Moore, according to a Federal Election Commission filing on Tuesday, after the party’s Senate campaign wing, the National Republican Senatorial Committee, ended a fundraising deal with him on Friday.  In Birmingham, Alabama, Jones told reporters his campaign had no plans to directly attack Moore over the allegations in a bid to capitalize on the furor. “We’re going to stay in our lane. We’re going to talk about the issues that we continue to talk about,” he said. “We will bring up his record, his previous record, other people will bring up the issues of the day. And people will have a choice.” Jones’ campaign released a new ad on Tuesday featuring Republican voters who say they are backing the Democrat. “I’m a Republican, but Roy Moore - no way,” one voter says in the ad. The national Democratic Party, however, has yet to invest directly in the race beyond funds to build the state party, and has not changed that stance since the Moore allegations surfaced. Earlier in the day, Sessions said in testimony before Congress that he had no reason to doubt the five women who have accused Moore of misconduct when they were in their teens. The House of Representatives’ top Republican, Speaker Paul Ryan, said he believed Moore’s accusers and that Moore should leave the race.  “If he cares about the values and people he claims to care about, then he should step aside,” Ryan told a news conference. On Monday, Beverly Young Nelson became the fifth woman to accuse Moore of misconduct, saying he sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. Moore said on Monday that Nelson’s accusations were “absolutely false.” Moore has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. Reuters was unable to independently confirm any of the allegations and accusations.  ",Senate leaders look to work with White House to block Moore

The letter, sent to all U.S. Congressmen by more than 100 state and local chambers of commerce and seen by Reuters, highlights frustration among Main Street businesses which have yet to benefit from President Donald Trump’s pledge to ease access to credit by slashing financial rules. Extra bank capital and liquidity requirements introduced by the 2010 Dodd-Frank law have slowed the flow of credit and seen many services and products for small businesses eliminated, the chambers wrote, citing Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation data.   “We believe Congress should develop common-sense reforms for community, mid-size and regional banks, which would help empower Main Street businesses. We urge you to make such legislation a priority,” the chambers wrote. The letter is likely to increase pressure on Democrats in the Senate to support a bipartisan bill unveiled by the Republican-led Senate Banking Committee on Monday that would offer some relief to community and regional banks by reducing the threshold at which they are considered systemically risky. That bill, which marks the first concrete congressional step toward rolling back Dodd-Frank, has nine Democratic co-sponsors, but Republicans will need to win over a handful of extra Democratic votes to be certain of its passage. Talks on the bill have dragged on for months, with Democratic lawmakers wary of appearing to offer handouts to big Wall Street banks. But they are growing more sympathetic to the idea of relaxing rules for small and regional lenders in order to make life easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs - especially with mid-term elections in 2018 looming, lobbyists said. David Hirschmann, president and CEO, Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which coordinated the letter, said there was a growing “crescendo” among Democratic lawmakers on the regulatory relief issue.  “A year ago with a Democrat president in the White House, you could not get nine Democrats to support even common-sense reforms like this. So what’s changed? Is it because they want to help Trump? No. It’s because they’re hearing about this from home. That’s what’s causing these Democrats to come forward and to say, ‘We need to fix this’,” he said. “There is a real understanding that if we don’t enable the banks, we are not going to have the small business lending we need. This is not a Wall Street issue; it’s a Main Street issue,” he added.  ",U.S. small business community pushes Congress on bank lending relief: letter
0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - British primatologist Jane Goodall sent a letter to every U.S. senator on Tuesday urging them to oppose a push in the U.S. Congress to allow oil drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a region environmentalists say is one of the world’s last paradises. The Republican-led Senate is trying to open up the 1002 region on the coastal plain of the ANWR, a region inhabited by Gwich’in natives, caribou herds, polar bears and millions of birds that migrate to six of the world’s seven continents. “If we violate the Arctic Refuge by extracting the oil beneath the land, this will have devastating impact for the Gwich’in people for they depend on the caribou herds to sustain their traditional way of life,” Goodall said in the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The ANWR’s “very wildness speaks to our deeply rooted spiritual connection to nature, a necessary element of human psyche,” wrote Goodall, best known for her study of chimpanzees in Tanzania. Last week, a group of 37 U.S.-based scientists whose research focuses on Arctic wildlife asked senators to not open the ANWR, saying that drilling would be “incompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established.” The Senate energy committee on Wednesday will consider a bill spurred by Senator Lisa Murkowski, a Republican from Alaska and the head of the panel, to hold at least two lease sales in the ANWR over the next 10 years.  Some Native Alaskans support drilling believing it will provide jobs. Matthew Rexford, a member of the Iñupiat tribe and the tribal administrator of the village of Kaktovik, has said he believes technological advances mean drilling can be performed with little impact to the land.   The administration of President Donald Trump is pursuing a policy to make the country “energy dominant” by maximizing oil, gas and coal production. Republicans say the 1002 portion of the ANWR is a “non wilderness area” because the government put it aside decades ago for drilling. Republicans have attached the ANWR measure to budget legislation, which needs only 50 votes to pass the Senate, but faces hurdles with many provisions being added to it.     Democrats are fighting the ANWR bill saying that Republicans are trying to sneak it through the budget process, and that it would not survive as stand-alone legislation that would need 60 votes to pass. Senator Maria Cantwell, the top Democrat on the energy committee, told Reuters she was urging her fellow lawmakers to listen to scientists. “Does it take the voice of Jane Goodall to beg Senators to stop hurting indigenous people and animals?” asked Cantwell.”  “She’s calling on them to set a conservation example instead of creating the next tragedy.” ",Jane Goodall urges U.S. Senate to halt quest for Arctic refuge oil

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions acknowledged on Tuesday he was aware of contact between Donald Trump’s election campaign and Russian intermediaries, again modifying a previous statement about the extent of connections to Moscow. The comment by Sessions to a House of Representatives panel did not reveal any new link between the Trump team and Russia but it was another example of the top U.S. law enforcement official offering a different version of events as lawmakers try to work out if the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the 2016 election. Sessions told the House Judiciary Committee that he now recalls a meeting last year with then-candidate Trump where a campaign adviser said he had connections with Moscow and could help arrange a Trump meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. “I do now recall” the meeting where adviser George Papadopoulos made the proposal, Sessions said, “but I have no clear recollection of the details of what he said during the meeting.” Sessions has previously told Congress he was unaware of any Trump campaign contacts with Russia, leading Democrats on Tuesday to accuse him of lying under oath. “I will not accept and reject accusations that I have ever lied under oath. That is a lie,” Sessions told the panel. Accusations of collusion with Russia during the election campaign have dogged Trump’s first 10 months in office. Sessions’ testimony appears likely to keep the controversy over Russia boiling as Special Counsel Robert Mueller accelerates his investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.  Since Mueller’s probe began, numerous Trump advisors have acknowledged interactions with Russian intermediaries. They include Donald Trump Jr., former campaign manager Paul Manafort, and Trump’s son-in-law and senior advisor, Jared Kushner. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russian representatives. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow meddled in the 2016 election to help Republican Trump’s campaign.          The Kremlin denies that and Trump says there was no collusion between his campaign and Russian officials. Sessions faced tough questioning from committee Democrats on Tuesday. Representative Hakeem Jeffries accused Sessions of hypocrisy, saying Sessions, while he was a U.S. attorney, had prosecuted a police officer for perjury after the officer corrected his testimony. “The Attorney General of the United States should not be held to a different standard than the young police officer whose life you ruined,” Jefferies said. That prompted an angry backlash from Sessions. “Nobody! Nobody - not you or anyone else, should be prosecuted, not me. . .for answering a question the way I did in this hearing. I have always tried to answer the questions fairly and accurately.” During the March 2016 campaign meeting where Russia was discussed, Sessions shut down Papadopoulos’ idea of engaging with Russian contacts, according to a source familiar with the matter.  Sessions said that was the version of events he recalled. “After reading his account, and to the best of my recollection, I believe that I wanted to make clear to him that he was not authorized to represent the campaign with the Russian government, or any other foreign government, for that matter,” Sessions said on Tuesday. After that meeting, Sessions said, he did not have “any further knowledge” of additional contacts between the campaign and Russian officials. It was not the first time that Sessions, who was a senior Trump campaign aide and Republican senator, has revised his comments about contact between the campaign and Russia.  He said during January’s confirmation hearing that he was unaware of such communications. News reports then emerged showing that Sessions had himself met Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016.   Under pressure, Sessions recused himself from the Russia investigation. He told reporters he was “honest and correct” in his response in the hearing, although he acknowledged he should have mentioned he had met with the ambassador in his role as a senator.  Sessions also said on Tuesday he did not challenge a statement by another campaign foreign policy adviser, Carter Page, that he told Sessions in a brief encounter that he was about to leave for Moscow. But he said he had no memory of that conversation. The hearing was starkly divided. Majority Republicans demanded that Sessions appoint a second special counsel to investigate a series of issues involving Trump’s election rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton, including the sale of a uranium company to Russia while she was U.S. secretary of state. Sessions was cautious on that score. When Republican Representative Jim Jordan detailed what the controversy “looks like” to him, the attorney general responded: “‘Looks like’ is not enough basis to appoint a special counsel.” Earlier, Sessions confirmed that he has asked senior federal prosecutors to look into the potential appointment of a second special counsel. Democrats say that five congressional committees have looked into the uranium sale and found nothing improper. ",Sessions changes statement about Trump campaign and Russia
0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The House of Representatives will adopt mandatory training on sexual harassment and discrimination, Speaker Paul Ryan said on Tuesday after members of Congress shared stories of women being propositioned and groped in the halls of the U.S. Capitol. “Our goal is not only to raise awareness, but also make abundantly clear that harassment in any form has no place in this institution,” the Republican speaker said in a statement. Ryan announced the new policy as a first step in the House’s review of sexual harassment policies after women lawmakers related in unflinching detail accounts of harassment and intimidation by House members and staff in Congress. The Committee on House Administration held a hearing on sexual harassment policies against a backdrop of social outrage over sexual misconduct by powerful men that began with allegations by multiple women against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. Roy Moore, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Alabama, has faced allegations by five women accusing him of sexual misconduct when they were teenagers. Ryan and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have urged Moore to drop out of the race. Moore has denied the allegations. U.S. Representative Jackie Speier told the panel that two current House members, a Republican and a Democrat, had engaged in sexual harassment. She did not identify the lawmakers. She said numerous staff members, both men and women, had been subjected to inexcusable and often illegal behavior. They included “propositions such as ‘Are you going to be a good girl?’ to perpetrators exposing their genitals, to victims having their private parts grabbed on the House floor,” she said. Speier later told MSNBC: “We do know that about $15 million has been paid out by the House on behalf of harassers in the last 10 to 15 years,” including one taxpayer-funded settlement on behalf of one of the current House members.  About 1,500 former congressional staffers have urged the House and Senate leadership to address the issue. The Senate passed a resolution last week to require training. Democratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a lead sponsor of that measure, said the next step was to make changes in how harassment complaints are handled. “You wonder why there’s only 21 women in the Senate or why there’s no women running Hollywood studios or there’s hardly any women running major businesses,” Klobuchar told reporters. “Well, when you have a work environment where people can’t get ahead without having to put out, that’s what happens.”  ","U.S. women lawmakers on sex harassment: Congress, heal thyself"
0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former government official criticized for being the principal author of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” was narrowly confirmed by the Senate on Tuesday as the top lawyer for the U.S. Department of Transportation in the Trump administration. Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer at Dechert LLP who was a senior Department of Justice lawyer under President George W. Bush, was criticized by both Republican and Democratic senators  before being confirmed by a 50-47 vote. “Mr. Bradbury’s memos were permission slips to torture,” Republican Senator John McCain, who was a Vietnam War prisoner  for 5-1/2 years after his plane was shot down over Hanoi in 1967, said on the Senate floor. “This is a dark, dark chapter in the history of the United States Senate.” Bradbury, who was nominated to the transportation post by President Donald Trump, defended his work in June before a Senate panel. He said the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree” on interrogation techniques and the memos represented his “best judgment of what the law required.” On Tuesday, Bradbury could not immediately be reached for comment. Described by the government at the time as “enhanced interrogation techniques,” the methods were used between 2001 and 2006 on detainees held during the Bush administration’s “War on Terror” following the Sept. 11 attacks.  McCain, who was the unsuccessful Republican Party presidential nominee in 2008, said the memos written by Bradbury provided a legal framework for the “inhumane interrogation” of detainees using methods such as “forced nudity and humiliation, facial and abdominal slapping, dietary manipulation” and “more than 48 hours of sleep deprivation.” Senator Rand Paul, another Republican who opposed Bradbury, said on Twitter “you shouldn’t get to author memos on torturing people & then get another government job.” Senator Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, in a separate speech, also criticized Bradbury for what she termed “a troubling history of disregard for United States and international law and seems unable to offer objective legal analysis.” She said he “helped justify the CIA’s torture program.”  “During a time when we needed independent voices in government to check the CIA’s actions, Bradbury failed to rise to the occasion. He failed to fulfill the responsibilities of his position,” Feinstein said. ",Senate approves Trump administration job for author of 'torture' memos
0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed a $700 billion defense policy bill on Tuesday, backing President Donald Trump’s call for a bigger, stronger military, but failing to decide how to fund the massive spending increase. The Republican-controlled House voted 356-70 for the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which authorizes the level of defense spending and sets policies controlling how the money is spent. But the legislation defies spending caps set in the 2011 Budget Control Act and there is no clear plan from Congress on how to provide the money for the Pentagon. The 2018 NDAA authorizes $634 billion in base defense spending, for such things as buying weapons and paying the troops, well above the $549 billion allowed under the previous legislation. The NDAA also includes provisions such as an increase in active troop levels by more than 16,000, and states that climate change is a national security threat. The defense policy bill will become law if it passes the Republican-controlled Senate and is signed into law by the president, as expected. But spending will nonetheless be cut automatically if Congress cannot come up with a deal to resolve the gap in funding. Representative Adam Smith, the top Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, said Congress’ failure to address the issue makes life more difficult for military leaders because they cannot plan in advance. “This defense bill is $72 billion over the budget caps, so if we don’t eliminate or raise the budget caps, that additional money will go away and leave us once again in the land of uncertainty for the Department of Defense,” he said. Representative Mac Thornberry, the House Armed Service Committee’s Republican chairman, said Congress needed to pass an appropriations bill to allow for the $700 billion. “Securing those appropriations must be Congress’ top priority before the year ends,” Thornberry said in a statement. The NDAA also includes about $66 billion in special war funding, which is exempt from the so-called sequestration cap. The measure passed by the House on Tuesday is a compromise reached by House and Senate negotiators between separate versions of the bill approved in the chambers earlier this year. However, a budget fight is expected because Senate Democrats may not agree to big increases in funds for the military if spending caps on non-defense programs are not also eased. The Republican majority in the Senate is so small that most legislation cannot pass without some Democratic votes. ","House backs $700 billion defense policy bill, funding uncertain"

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday denied that he misled legislators when he previously failed to disclose a meeting he attended with then-candidate Donald Trump and aides where campaign connections to Russia were discussed. Sessions testified in Congress that, following a guilty plea by Trump campaign foreign policy advisor George Papadopoulos, he now remembers a March 2016 meeting at which Papadopoulos was present and suggested he could arrange a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Democratic Representative Ted Lieu, who sits on the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, said on Twitter on Tuesday he believes Sessions committed perjury when he previously denied knowledge of contact between Trump’s campaign and Russia.  The following describes the crime of perjury and whether it would apply to Sessions’ conduct. What is perjury?     A person can be convicted of perjury only if they intentionally make a false statement under oath about a fact pertinent to a relevant investigation or criminal case. Under federal law the penalty for perjury is a prison sentence of up to five years or eight years in terrorism-related cases. “You can’t x-ray people’s minds to see what they were thinking and what they knew, so perjury can be a difficult crime to prove,” said Bennett Gershman, a professor of criminal law at Pace Law School.  Did Sessions commit perjury?     Some legal experts said there is a strong argument that Sessions committed perjury at an Oct. 18 oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. During that hearing, Democratic Senator Al Franken asked Sessions whether “surrogates from the Trump campaign had communications with the Russians.” Sessions responded, “I did not, and I’m not aware of anyone else that did, and I don’t believe it happened.” Gershman said that Sessions’ failure to disclose the Papadopoulos meeting could amount to perjury. Perjury prosecutions based on congressional testimony are rare, in part because lawmakers often ask circuitous questions. But in this case Franken asked a straightforward question and the response Sessions gave was misleading, Gershman said. However, Stuart Green, a professor of criminal law at Rutgers University School of Law, said Sessions would have a plausible argument that Papadopoulos’ communications were not the type of contacts Franken was asking about since they were with Russian government intermediaries rather than Russian officials. “There’s a bit of wiggle room there,” Green said.     What if Sessions says he forgot about Papadopoulos’ remarks?     Sessions said at the hearing on Tuesday that he forgot about the March 2016 meeting because the Trump campaign was “a form of chaos” from the beginning. “We traveled all the time, sometimes to several places in one day. Sleep was in short supply,” he said. A prosecutor could use circumstantial evidence to undermine such a defense, lawyers said. Gershman said Sessions’ statement that he did not recall Papadopoulos’ remarks at the meeting would raise skepticism since Sessions led the meeting, Trump attended it and important national security matters were discussed. “It’s something a person would be hard-pressed to claim they don’t remember,” he said.      Who could prosecute Sessions for perjury?     Any charges against Sessions would likely be brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Green said that Mueller’s mandate clearly encompasses looking into whether Sessions tried to conceal the extent of Russia’s influence in the election. But Gershman noted that Mueller may be reluctant to charge Sessions with perjury because the case would not be solid. “When you bring a charge against a high-profile figure you don’t want to lose because then it looks like a witchunt,” he said.     ",Q&A: Did Sessions break the law by denying knowledge of Russia contacts?

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell led a chorus of establishment Republicans on Monday urging Roy Moore, the party’s Senate candidate in Alabama, to quit the race as a fifth woman came forward with allegations Moore had sexual contact with teenage girls decades ago. Beverly Young Nelson said Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16 and he was a prosecuting attorney in his 30s. At a New York news conference, the tearful Nelson said Moore groped her, tried to pull her shirt off and shove her head in his lap, then warned that “no one will believe you” if she told anyone. “I was twisting and struggling and begging him to stop,” said Nelson, a waitress at an Alabama restaurant where Moore often ate when the incident occurred. “I had tears running down my face.” Moore, a Christian conservative and former chief justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, has refused to withdraw from the race. His campaign released a statement denying “any sexual misconduct with anyone” and saying the new allegations were part of a “witch hunt.” At a news conference in Gallant, Alabama on Monday night, Moore told reporters that Nelson’s accusations are “absolutely false,” the Birmingham News reported. “I never did what she said I did,” the newspaper quoted Moore as saying. “I don’t even know the woman. I don’t know anything about her.” McConnell told reporters in his home state of Kentucky that party officials were considering whether a Republican write-in candidate could be found to challenge Moore in the Dec. 12 special election. “I think he should step aside,” said McConnell, who previously said Moore should leave the race if the allegations were true. “I believe the women.” Republican Senators Orrin Hatch, Susan Collins, Lindsey Graham, Todd Young and Cory Gardner joined McConnell in calling for Moore to drop out - a move that could open the door for Democrats to cut into Republicans’ narrow two-seat Senate majority. Gardner, the head of the Senate Republican campaign arm, said Moore was unfit to serve in the Senate. “If he refuses to withdraw and wins, the Senate should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate,” Gardner said in a statement. Senator John Cornyn, the Senate’s No. 2 Republican, withdrew his endorsement but said Alabama voters should make the final judgment on Moore. Another prominent conservative who had endorsed Moore, Senator Ted Cruz, said Moore should either clearly refute the allegations or if they are true, drop out. “I am not able to urge the people of Alabama to support his candidacy so long as these allegations remain unrefuted,” Cruz told reporters in the Capitol.  Moore, 70, had been a heavy favorite to win the election against Democrat Doug Jones. He has denied the allegations first raised in a Washington Post story about his relationships with four women when they were teenagers, including a charge he initiated sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. He said on Twitter that McConnell was the person who should step down. “He has failed conservatives and must be replaced,” Moore said. The state party and many other Alabama Republicans have not wavered in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive Republican primary victory in September over Luther Strange. Strange, who drew the support of President Donald Trump in the primary, had been appointed to fill the seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he became U.S. attorney general earlier this year. The growing furor over Moore sets up a confrontation between establishment Republicans and Moore’s supporters in the party’s populist movement led by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon. A Democratic win in Alabama would be a blow to Trump’s agenda and shift the political outlook for next year’s congressional elections, giving Democrats a stronger shot at recapturing control of the Senate. It is too late to remove Moore’s name from the ballot, but McConnell told reporters he was “looking at” potential write-in candidates who could mount a successful campaign. Asked if Strange might be a candidate again, he said: “We’ll see.” But Strange told reporters it was “highly unlikely” he would mount a write-in campaign. “Now it’s going to really be up to the people of our state to sort this out,” he said. A special-election victory had been a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones, a former federal prosecutor, was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls. Moore, who is prone to incendiary comments on social and cultural issues, has survived controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. He threatened over the weekend to sue the Post and said the allegations were a smear campaign by his political opponents. Reuters has been unable to independently confirm any of the allegations. While making the new allegations, Nelson showed reporters Moore’s signature in her high school yearbook. She said he had offered to give her a ride home one night, then pulled the car behind the restaurant and assaulted her. “I was terrified,” she said. “I thought he was going to rape me.” Nelson said she told her sister about the attack two years afterward, and eventually told her mother and husband. She said she backed Trump for president and was not coming forward because of politics but because she was inspired by the women who talked to the Post.

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee on Tuesday held the first congressional hearing in more than four decades on the president’s authority to launch a nuclear strike, amid concern that tensions over North Korea’s weapons program could lead to war. Senator Bob Corker, Republican chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, held the hearing as President Donald Trump wrapped up a 12-day trip to Asia largely dominated by concerns about Pyongyang’s nuclear ambitions. Corker acknowledged that senators, including Democrats and Trump’s fellow Republicans, have raised questions about Trump’s authority to wage war, use nuclear weapons and enter into or end international agreements. Trump has traded insults and threats with North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un and used expressions like “fire and fury” to hint that any use of lethal force against North Korea would be overwhelming. On Sunday, he again insulted Kim by calling him “short and fat.” Corker himself warned last month that Trump might be putting the United States “on the path to World War Three.” But on Tuesday Corker said the hearing was not intended to target Trump. “This is not specific to anybody,” he said. Democrats made clear they were concerned about Trump. “We are concerned that the president of the United States is so unstable, is so volatile, has a decision-making process that is so quixotic, that he might order a nuclear weapons strike that is wildly out of step with U.S. national security interests,” Senator Chris Murphy said. During the hearing, retired General Robert Kehler, former commander of U.S. Strategic Command, said the military can refuse to follow what it considers an illegal order, even a nuclear one. But it was not clear after questions from committee members how that process would work. Some senators want legislation to alter the president’s nuclear authority. Corker said he did not now support that idea. “I do not see a legislative solution today, but that doesn’t mean that over the course of the next several months one might develop,” he told reporters after the hearing. Some senators seemed to bristle about the hearing’s tone, warning against comments depicting Trump as unable to strongly retaliate for any attack. “Every single word that has been uttered this morning at this hearing is going to be analyzed in Pyongyang,” said Republican Senator Jim Risch, who is in line to become chairman after Corker retires next year.

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte attacked Canada’s Justin Trudeau at the end of a summit of Asian and Western nations for raising questions about his war on drugs, a topic skirted by other leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump. At the traditional news conference by the host nation at the end of the summit on Tuesday, Duterte was asked how he had responded to the Canadian prime minister raising the issue of human rights and extra-judicial killings in his anti-drugs drive. “I said I will not explain. It is a personal and official insult,” the Philippines president said in the course of a rambling answer, although he did not refer to Trudeau by name. “I only answer to the Filipino. I will not answer to any other bullshit, especially foreigners. Lay off.” Earlier in the day, Trudeau told a news conference that during his meeting with Duterte “the president was receptive to my comments and it was throughout a very cordial and positive exchange”. Human rights activists had been hoping that leaders at the summit, including Trump, would raise the issue of the thousands of users and small-time pushers killed in the campaign that was launched by Duterte after he took office in mid-2016. His government says the police act in self-defense during drug-busts, but critics say executions are taking place with no accountability. There was no pressure from Trump on the drugs war when he met Duterte on Monday and the U.S. president later said the two had a “great relationship”. A joint statement after the meeting only said the two sides “underscored that human rights and the dignity of human life are essential, and agreed to continue mainstreaming the human rights agenda in their national programs.” Duterte cursed Trump’s predecessor, Barack Obama, last year for raising concerns about the war on drugs and he subsequently declared that he was breaking ties with the United States, a close ally of the Philippines since World War Two. The relationship appears to have got back on track after the bonhomie between him and Trump. Trudeau also said that he raised the issue of the exodus of Rohingya during a meeting with Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, another sensitive topic bypassed by most other leaders, although he did not mention the Muslim minority by name. “This is a tremendous concern to Canada and to many, many countries around the world,” he said. The government in mostly-Buddhist Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and does not recognize the term. Over 600,000 Rohingya have fled to refugee camps in Bangladesh since military clearance operations were launched in response to attacks by Rohingya militants on Aug. 25.  The plight of the Rohingya has brought outrage from around the world and the United Nations has called the operations ethnic cleansing. There have been calls for democracy champion Suu Kyi to be stripped of the Nobel peace prize she won in 1991 because she has not condemned the military’s actions. Some countries in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), particularly Muslim-majority Malaysia, have voiced strong concern over the issue recently. However, in keeping with ASEAN’s principle of non-interference in each others’ internal affairs, it appeared to have been put aside at the summit, which brought Southeast Asian nations together with the United States, Russia, Japan, China, India, Australia, New Zealand and Canada. Duterte reported that China had agreed at the summit to work on a code of conduct in the South China Sea with ASEAN nations to ease tensions over disputed claims to the busy and resource-rich waterway. The group also signed agreements on protecting migrant labor and fighting terrorism and cybercrime. Trump skipped the plenary session of the summit because of scheduling delays, but he said his marathon trip to Asia had been a “tremendous” success. He told reporters on Air Force One that he had delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch before the summit meeting.  Trump said at least $300 billion, possibly triple that figure, of deals had been agreed in the trip. He did not elaborate. “We’ve explained that the United States is open for trade but we want reciprocal, we want fair trade for the United States,” he said. Trade and concern about possible protectionism under Trump’s “America First” agenda have come up during his visit to the region, which included stops in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam before concluding in the Philippines. After Trump left Manila, a group of Asia-Pacific nations pursuing a separate Beijing-backed trade deal that does not include the United States agreed to “intensify efforts” in 2018 to bring their negotiations to a conclusion. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) appeared to have been given new impetus at the summit by Trump’s withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement, to which China is not party. The two trade deals are not mutually exclusive. ASEAN is joined in the RCEP talks by China, India, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and South Korea.

In testimony before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, Sessions acknowledged he attended a meeting with George Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser who pleaded guilty last month to lying to the FBI. According to court documents, Papadopoulos told the meeting he could help use his Russian connections to broker a meeting between then-candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin.

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican and Democratic leaders of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee blasted the U.S. State Department on Tuesday for cuts in staff and what they described as a failure to have a plan for a proposed reorganization. “I don’t think they are anywhere close to having a plan to present relative to the reforms that they want,” said Senator Bob Corker, the Republican chairman of the committee. Rex Tillerson, Republican President Donald Trump’s Secretary of State, has embraced the White House’s proposal - rejected by key members of Congress - to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent. He has imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency’s operations and deciding how to reorganize them. Tillerson, a former chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp who took office on Feb. 1, has offered few specifics to ease concerns, including in Congress, that the plan risks weakening U.S. standing in the world. Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Foreign Relations panel, called the staff reductions a risk to national security and a “high-level decapitation of leadership.” “Folks, this situation is alarming. We put our country in danger,” Cardin said during a committee business meeting. Corker said the panel had had “a very unsatisfactory meeting last week with the State Department” and that concern was bipartisan. “We need to be much more focused on holding them accountable,” Corker said. Trump has several times contradicted Tillerson on foreign policy issues. The president said earlier this month that his opinion was the only one that mattered in U.S. foreign policy. “The one that matters is me,” Trump said on Fox News. “I‘m the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that’s what the policy is going to be.” ",Senators blast State Department over cuts

0,True,"November 12, 2017 ",politicsNews,"MANILA (Reuters) - Leaders from across Asia joined U.S. President Donald Trump at an extravagant gala dinner in the Philippines’ capital on Sunday, a show of amity in a region fraught with tensions that have lurked behind his marathon tour of the continent. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte set the tone of cordiality ahead of the two days of summit meetings he will host, suggesting that despite their differences over claims to the South China Sea, the leaders should not discuss the issue. “We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues,” Duterte said at a business conference, as planes carrying heads of state and government attending the summit landed in quick succession in Manila.  “The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war. It can ill-afford a violent confrontation.” Hours earlier, during a bilateral visit to Vietnam, Trump offered to mediate in the dispute over the South China Sea, where four Southeast Asian countries and Taiwan contest China’s sweeping claims to the busy waterway. All the claimants will be at the summit, except for Taiwan. Trump will join leaders of Southeast and East Asian nations in Manila over the next two days, the last leg of a tour that has taken him to Japan, South Korea and China as well as Vietnam. The sheer length of the trip - the longest to Asia by a U.S. president in more than a quarter century - may reassure some that, despite Trump’s “America First” policy, Washington remains committed to a region China sees as its strategic domain. Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), China, Russia, Japan, Canada, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand arrived one by one for a glitzy gala dinner where they were entertained by singers and dancers. Each of the men sported a cream-colored barong, a traditional Philippines shirt made of fiber from the pineapple plant, embroidered and worn untucked. They were served a four-course Filipino-Asian fusion meal curate and prepared by Chef Jessie Sincioco, who also designed the menu for Pope Francis when he visited the Philippines in 2015. Police used water canon to prevent hundreds of protesters reaching the U.S. embassy in Manila ahead of Trump’s arrival. Carrying placards declaring “Dump Trump” and “Down with U.S. Imperialism”, the left-wing protesters were blocked by police in riot gear with shields and batons, and then showered with jets of water from a fire engine. The United States and its former colony, the Philippines,  have been strategic allies since World War Two.  Trump is expected to try during the summit to shore up relations, which have been strained by the mercurial Duterte’s notorious anti-U.S. sentiment and his enthusiasm for better ties with Russia and China. Duterte - sometimes described as the ‘Trump of the East’ because of his brash style - said last week he would tell the U.S. president to “lay off” if he raised the issue of human rights when they met. More than 3,900 Filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in a war on drugs declared by Duterte. Critics say executions are taking place with no accountability, allegations the police reject. But Trump, who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad, praised Duterte in May for doing an “unbelievable job on the drug problem”. “INDO-PACIFIC” Trump’s tour comes against a background of tensions on the Korean peninsula following exchanges of war-like threats and insults between North Korea’s leader Kim Jong Un and Trump over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile development program. China has been urged by both South Korea and the United States to take a more active role in curbing North Korea’s nuclear and missile ambitions. During his tour, Trump and his team have repeatedly used the term “Indo-Pacific” instead of “Asia-Pacific” for the region, which some see as an effort to depict it as more than China-dominated. Pacific Rim nation leaders agreed in Vietnam on Saturday to address “unfair trade practices” and “market distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. The summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) countries in Vietnam put on show the contrasting vision of the “America First” policy with the traditional consensus favoring multinational deals that China now seeks to champion. Manila hosted the APEC summit two years ago, and at that meeting Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader there. Journalists swarmed the youthful leader and screamed in excitement. On his latest visit, Trudeau visited an outlet of Jollibee, a chain that has become a byword for Filipino fast food, chatting and posing for selfies, charming the people of Manila again.

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A year after Donald Trump was elected president on a promise to revive the ailing U.S. coal industry, the sector’s long-term prospects for growth and hiring remain as bleak as ever. A Reuters review of mining data shows an industry that has seen only modest gains in jobs and production this year - much of it from a temporary uptick in foreign demand for U.S. coal rather than presidential policy changes. U.S. utilities are shutting coal-fired power plants at a rapid pace and shifting to cheap natural gas, along with wind and solar power. And domestic demand makes up about 90 percent of the market for U.S. coal. “We’re not planning to build any additional coal facilities,” said Melissa McHenry, a spokeswoman for American Electric Power, one of the largest U.S. utilities. “The future for coal is dictated by economics … and you can’t make those kinds of investments based on one administration’s politics.”  Coal plants now make up 47 percent of AEP’s capacity for power generation, a figure it plans to shrink to 33 percent by 2030. (For a graphic on coal production, demand and employment, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zKY1tQ) The situation highlights the limitations of presidential policy on major industries and global economic trends. As some energy experts have said all along, the forces that will make or break mining are well beyond the powers of the Oval Office. A White House official did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has likely done all he can do to help the industry, said Luke Popovich, a spokesman for the National Mining Association, which represents major U.S. coal companies.  “The government is no longer against us,” he said. “We now only have market forces to contend with.” Trump has taken action on many promises he made to coal interests in states that helped him win the election. The president started the process of killing former President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, meant to reduce carbon emissions from power plants; ended an Obama-era moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands; ditched limits on dumping coal waste into streams; and started withdrawing the United States from the Paris Climate Agreement. Now Trump’s Energy Secretary, Rick Perry, is attempting to push a rule through the independent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that would subsidize power plants that store at least a 90-day supply of coal on site. The goal is to extend the life of some coal burning power plants, a move Perry says will make the electric grid more reliable. While the full impact of Trump’s coal policy could take years to understand, the changes so far are unlikely to boost domestic demand, energy analysts and utility officials said. Trump has cast the coal industry as a victim of burdensome regulation. The industry has lost more than 40 percent of its work force in less than a decade and seen production drop to its lowest levels since 1978. Its share of the power market has fallen to less than a third from about half in 2003. “We’re going to bring the coal industry back 100 percent,” Trump said at a rally in Virginia in August of 2016. So far, progress has been limited. U.S. coal production is on track to rise more than 8 percent in 2017 over the previous year, to 790 million tons, according to the Energy Information Administration. But 2018 output is expected to decline. The number of coal miners has also risen slightly to 51,900 in October, up about 2,200 since November 2016 - but down about 70 percent from a 1985 peak, according to the Labor Department. On November 1, Trump cited the modest production increases in a Tweet, saying, “It is finally happening for our great clean coal miners!” But these increases are largely attributable to demand for U.S. coal from Asian steel mills after temporary outages from their usual suppliers in Australia, according to James Stevenson, a coal analyst at IHS Markit. During the first six months of 2017, Asian countries took in 7.5 million short tons of U.S. coal, up 97 percent over the same period in 2016, according to the EIA. That demand will soon fade, Stevenson said. “We are not going to get a repeat of 2017,” he said of the spike in exports. Forecasts from utilities and the U.S. government reveal little reason for hope of a sustained coal rebound. Utilities are expected to shut down more than 13,600 megawatts of coal plant capacity in 2018. That follows a loss of nearly 8,000 MW this year and 13,000 MW in 2016, according to EIA and Thomson Reuters data.  By 2025, coal-fired power plant capacity will dip to 226,380 MW, down about 30 percent from 2011, according to EIA. Three Texas coal plants owned by Vistra Energy Corp subsidiary Luminant are among the latest to close, bringing the number of plants that shut, or plan to, to 265 since 2010 - a figure higher than the 258 plants that remain, according to the Sierra Club, which has campaigned against coal. Vistra said the closures were forced by lower prices for natural gas and renewable power - and not by environmental regulations. Duke Energy, one of the country’s largest utilities, has shut down more than 5,400 MW of coal capacity since 2011 and plans to shed another 2,000 MW by 2024. Over the next decade, Duke plans to invest $11 billion in new natural gas and renewable power - and nothing in new coal-fired generation, said spokesman Rick Rhodes. A Nov. 2 report by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis - which has two of the largest coal producers in its district, Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc - said coal-fired power plants “may eventually become obsolete.” Coal companies believe they can survive despite the troubling market outlook. Peabody expects a “modest number” of coal power plant retirements in the coming years, with some of that lost capacity shifting to remaining plants that will increase output, spokesman Vic Svec said. Arch spokeswoman Logan Bonacorsi offered a similar forecast.   Robert Murray, the chief executive of privately-held Murray Energy Corp - one of America’s biggest underground miners - said Trump could do more for the industry. The administration, Murray said, should end tax breaks for wind and solar power and reverse an EPA finding that carbon emissions endanger human health. But Trump’s tax bill last week preserved most solar incentives, which have bi-partisan backing. And the EPA has so far steered clear of the so-called “endangerment finding” on emissions that is the basis of many fossil-fuel regulations, given the breadth of scientific evidence that would be needed to reverse it. Murray Energy, meanwhile, announced on Oct. 31 it will buy a 30.5 percent stake in a coal-mining partnership in Utah called Canyon Consolidated Resources, LLC. The deal might help the companies cut costs, but it’s unlikely to help workers: Murray said about 200 of 1,000 jobs in Utah could be lost.

The Washington Post and New York Times cited a letter from the Justice Department to the Republican chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, Robert Goodlatte, responding to his request for the appointment of a special counsel to look into various matters. The letter quoted Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd as saying that Sessions had ""directed senior federal prosecutors to evaluate certain issues raised in your letters,"" according to the Post, which first reported the story (wapo.st/2zEwN7a) Those prosecutors would then make recommendations “as to whether any matters not currently under investigation should be opened, whether any matters currently under investigation require further resources, or whether any matters merit the appointment of a Special Counsel,” the letter said. Last month, Republican leaders of two House committees launched an investigation into an Obama-era deal in which a Russian company bought a Canadian firm that owned some 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies. Some Republicans have charged that the State Department under then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton approved the deal after her husband’s charitable foundation received a $145 million donation. Democrats have accused Republicans of launching a spurious investigation of Clinton, the 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, to divert attention from Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged links between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. Representative Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee, said five congressional committees, including the oversight panel, had investigated the deal and “identified no evidence to substantiate allegations that Secretary Clinton orchestrated, manipulated, or otherwise coerced” the interagency committee to approve the deal.

0,True,"November 14, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A proposal by the U.S. Senate to change the way shares in startup companies are taxed incited panic and dread in Silicon Valley on Monday, with startup founders and investors warning of nothing less than the demise of their industry should the proposal become law. The provision in the Senate’s tax reform plan, which appeared to catch the industry by surprise, involves the treatment of employee stock options. These options give the holder the right to purchase shares in the future at a set price and can be very valuable if a company does well and the share price increases. Options are often a major portion of the compensation for  startup employees and founders, who take lower salaries in anticipation of a big payout if their startup takes off. Options typically vest over a four-year period. Senate Republicans have now proposed taxing those stock options as they vest and before startup employees have the opportunity to cash them in, resulting in annual tax bills that could easily climb into the tens of thousands of dollars, say startup founders and venture capitalists. “If there were a single piece of legislation to adversely affect startups, it would be this,” said Venky Ganesan, managing director at venture capital firm Menlo Ventures. “Everyone is freaked out.” Justin Field, vice president of government affairs at the National Venture Capital Association, said that the Senate’s proposed tax change would be “crippling” to the startup industry. How far the provision gets remains to be seen. The National Venture Capital Association was successful in getting a similar proposal removed from the House tax bill, although it “didn’t fully appreciate” the Senate’s intention to add the tax provision, Field said. The association also helped to steer lawmakers away from a proposal discussed late last year to tax venture capitalists’ profits on investments at a higher rate. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio, a member of the Senate Committee on Finance, has filed an amendment to repeal the provision in the tax bill, according to his spokesman.  Under current tax code, employees are taxed only when they exercise their options. Options are exercised when the price they were granted at—known as the strike price—is lower than the share price, and some shares can then be sold to pay the taxes. But the Senate proposal would require startup employees to pay regular income tax on the value gain of their stock options even before they are exercised. These options are illiquid assets, and cannot be spent or saved. “What this would mean is every month, when your equity compensation vests a little bit, you will owe taxes on it even though you can’t do anything with that equity compensation,” Fred Wilson, a venture capitalist with Union Square Ventures, wrote on his blog Monday. For instance, if a startup employee receives stock options at a dollar per share, and the shares increase in value by $1 every year during the four-year vesting period, the employee would have to pay income tax on $1 per share after the first year, pay again on the $1 increase in value after the second year, and so on. When that employee owns hundreds of thousands and even millions of shares, that is a hefty bill to pay. And there is always the risk the startup will eventually fail. “This reform will force the average employee to pay taxes on that bet well before they even know if it’s a winning ticket,” said Amanda Kahlow, founder and executive chairman of marketing data startup 6sense. For startup founders in particular, such a tax bill could be ruinous.  “It would mean that I would have to sell the company,” said Shoaib Makani, founder and chief executive of long-haul trucking startup KeepTruckin. “I have zero net worth aside from the common stock I hold in the company. It would be impossible. I would be in default.” Some executives in the startup industry, however, have pushed for companies to move toward bigger salaries so employees are not so dependent on options to buy a house or pay for other large expenses. And when startups suffer valuation cuts, employees can end up with worthless options. The Senate’s proposal came as a revenue-generating measure to help offset tax breaks in the bill. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican and chairman of the Senate Committee on Finance, did not respond to requests for comment and other Republicans on the committee were not immediately available.  A spokeswoman for Senator Ron Wyden, the committee’s ranking member and a Democrat, said he was aware of concerns that the provision would limit startups’ ability to attract talent.

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said he returned to work on Monday, more than a week after he suffered six broken ribs when tackled by a neighbor while mowing his lawn. “While I’m still in a good deal of pain, I will be returning to work in the Senate today, ready to fight for liberty and help move forward with tax cuts in the coming days and weeks,” the Republican senator Paul said on a Twitter post. The man accused of tackling Paul and breaking his ribs, Rene Boucher, 59, pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said. Boucher is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year of imprisonment if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30.  Boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep at least 1,000 feet (305 m) away from Paul remained in effect. Paul, 54, told police that Boucher came on his property in a gated community near Bowling Green and tackled him from behind, the Bowling Green Daily News reported, citing an arrest warrant. Paul previously said on Twitter he suffered the broken ribs from the Nov. 3 incident and that X-rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest. Media reports have said Boucher, also a physician like Paul, had a long-running dispute with the senator. But Paul, in a Washington Examiner interview published Monday, said he had no dispute with Boucher and had not spoken to his neighbor in a decade. He said he knew of no motive for the incident. Paul could not be reached by Reuters Monday. “My first encounter was basically being hit in the back,” he said. “We’ve never had words over anything, we’ve never had a dispute or discussion or words.” The Kentucky State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating the incident, according to Warren County Attorney Amy Milliken. Citing unnamed sources, Fox News reported on Thursday that Paul had been told federal charges were expected in the case. “There is going to be a criminal prosecution,” Paul told the Examiner but did not elaborate on what he meant. There are no updates on the federal charges, David Habich, an FBI spokesman in Louisville, said in an email on Monday. The senator’s office declined to comment on possible federal charges on Monday.

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted Monday to approve a senior Transportation Department nominee and advance another nomination, after Republicans accused Democrats of blocking some nominees to push for funding of a New York area infrastructure project. Derek Kan, who was previously an official at San Francisco-based ride services company Lyft Inc, won confirmation to be undersecretary of transportation for policy on a 90-7 vote.  Senate Republicans have said their Democratic rivals were stalling a number of nominees over a dispute over funding for the $24 billion “Gateway Program,” which includes building a new tunnel underneath New York’s Hudson River. At least eight other Transportation Department nominations are pending and other jobs vacant, including a top auto safety regulator. In addition to confirming Kan, the Senate voted 50-47 on Monday to advance the nomination of Steven Bradbury, a Washington lawyer, to be general counsel at the Transportation Department. During the administration of President George W. Bush, Bradbury was one of the principal authors of the legal justifications for “enhanced interrogation techniques” called the “torture memos” by critics. Senator Tammy Duckworth, an Illinois Democrat, said in June that Bradbury “lacked the judgment to stand up against (the Bush) administration’s use of torture.” Bradbury defended his work in June, saying the “questions we addressed raised difficult issues about which reasonable people could disagree.” In September, President Donald Trump met with top elected officials from New York and New Jersey over the fate of the Gateway Program deemed critical to northeast U.S. transportation, but Trump made no commitments to finance the project. Republican Senator John Thune accused Democrats of holding nominations “hostage” while awaiting “assurances that the Trump administration will approve and fund” the Gateway project. “While no one questions the importance of this corridor,  there are many other important projects that also are awaiting approval and funding at the Department. No project should get to cut the line based on the machinations of a handful of our” colleagues, Thune said. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said on Monday he opposed Kan because of administration roadblocks to the project. “Time is running out and we must quickly build new tunnels,” Schumer said. A Senate Democratic aide confirmed, separately, that  Democrats were holding up some nominations “because they want assurances from the Transportation Department the Gateway Project will quickly move forward after it’s funded.” The Transportation Department regulates the nation’s vehicles, airplanes, railroads, pipelines, ports and highways.

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Republicans pushed ahead on Monday on a U.S. tax code overhaul as a Senate panel considered the issue, but risks lay ahead with major intraparty disputes unsettled and President Donald Trump returning soon from Asia as the debate heats up. While overseas at a leaders conference, Trump tweeted some tax bill suggestions early on Monday that were starkly different from the two Republican plans being considered in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives. He called on lawmakers to add a highly risky provision to their tax effort: repealing the individual mandate included in the 2010 Obamacare health insurance law that requires Americans to have health coverage or pay a tax to Washington. Neither of the two Republican plans includes such a politically divisive measure. Efforts by Republicans to dismantle Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, collapsed dramatically months ago. Trump has pushed hard for adding the mandate repeal to the tax-cut package. He tweeted the same suggestion on Nov. 3 just before he departed for his multi-nation Asian tour. In his latest tweet, he also urged slashing the top tax rate for high earners to 35 percent from 39.6 percent, despite criticism from Democrats that the Republican tax bills are deficit-expanding giveaways to the rich and corporations. The House retains the existing top tax rate in its bill, while the Senate proposes cutting it slightly to 38.5 percent. Trump is set to return to Washington on Tuesday. A White House aide confirmed that the president would speak to House Republicans on Thursday ahead of their expected tax bill vote. “I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We’re getting close!” Trump wrote in his Monday Twitter post. “Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts?” he added. Since taking office in January, Trump has not scored a major legislative accomplishment, while frequently shifting positions and confusing lawmakers on Capitol Hill on various issues. Many Republicans view a win on overhauling the tax code as crucial to avoiding having to go to the voters in 2018’s congressional elections with no achievements to show for a year in control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. The clock is ticking for them. The House is expected to vote soon, perhaps on Thursday, on a tax bill approved last week at the committee level. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he was confident Republicans had the votes for passage. Brady told reporters in a Capitol hallway that including a repeal of the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate in the tax bill “remains under consideration.”  The Senate tax committee will debate its tax plan all week before heading home for the U.S. Thanksgiving Day holiday. When both chambers return near the end of November, they will have only 12 legislative days before the end of 2017. In that time span, Republicans hope to iron out differences between the two tax plans over the deduction for state and local taxes, the timing of a corporate tax rate cut and the future of the estate tax on inheritances. Each of the Republican tax plans would add about $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade, another issue causing dissension among Republicans. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped to have a tax bill ready in the week after Thanksgiving. Between now and then, an army of lobbyists will be pressuring lawmakers to protect favored special-interest tax breaks. On Dec. 8, a three-month extension of the spending authority for the federal government expires, requiring congressional action that could divert lawmakers from the tax overhaul. A lengthy amendment introduced on Monday to the Senate tax plan by Republican Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax panel, would remove a provision that lets working Americans over 50 make tax-free catch-up contributions to their retirement plans. Democrats have kept up steady criticism of the Republican tax bills and how they were drafted. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate measure was developed in secret by a small group that held no public hearings and ignored Democrats. “And the reason for such reckless haste is all too obvious: the product is a wretched one ... it is focused on the wealthy to the exclusion of the middle class,” he said in a statement.

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday said he is nominating former pharmaceutical executive and industry lobbyist Alex Azar to serve as U.S. Health and Human Services secretary, saying Azar would push to lower the price of medicines. Republicans as well as the lead lobby groups for drugmakers and health insurers welcomed Azar as an experienced hand who could help overhaul the world’s most costly healthcare system.  But several Democratic lawmakers questioned whether he would tackle changes that cut into pharmaceutical profits. If confirmed, Azar also would take the lead in implementing Trump’s campaign promise to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s 2010 healthcare overhaul that extended health insurance to 20 million Americans. Democratic Representative Elijah Cummings said Trump’s pick of a former pharmaceutical executive was “like a fox guarding the hen house.” Trump, who is in the Philippines on a diplomatic trip, announced the nomination on Twitter by saying Azar would “be a star for better healthcare and lower drug prices.” Trump’s first health secretary, former U.S. Representative Tom Price, resigned in September amid a public furor over his use of expensive taxpayer-funded private charter jets for government travel.   Azar worked at Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Co for a decade, including five years as president of its Lilly USA unit, and left the company in January, according to his LinkedIn page.  Cummings and Senator Bernie Sanders, a 2016 Democratic presidential candidate, last year called for a federal probe into whether Eli Lilly, Sanofi SA (SASY.PA), Merck & Co Inc (MRK.N) and Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVOb.CO) colluded to set prices on insulin and other diabetes drugs. “This is a slap in the face to millions of Americans who are waiting on (the President) to take action to lower drug prices,” Cummings wrote on Twitter. He also pointed to Eli Lilly raising drug prices by double digits while Azar was an executive at the company. Azar, though a spokesman, declined to comment. Other Democrats were more cautious in their response to Trump’s announcement, with Senator Chuck Schumer calling for the health agency to turn over a new leaf with Azar. Democratic Senator Patty Murray, who has been working on bipartisan healthcare legislation, tweeted, “Given Alex Azar’s professional background, there are concerns on whether he can fairly execute any significant effort to lower drug prices for patients & families.” Republicans were supportive with Senate health committee head Lamar Alexander of Tennessee describing Azar as a qualified, experienced nominee. Azar also drew praise from PhRMA, the largest pharmaceutical industry trade group and America’s Health Insurance Plans, the key lobbyist for the insurer industry. Azar served several years on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobbying group, and earlier was general counsel and deputy secretary for Health and Human Services under former Republican President George W. Bush. Patient advocacy organization Public Citizen said Azar has made it clear he is opposed to measures “to restrain prescription companies’ profiteering and limit improper marketing” and that he favors weaker safety approval standards. As head of HHS, Azar would have oversight responsibility for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which regulates the drug industry including approving new treatments.       Azar’s nomination must be approved by the U.S. Senate, which is controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. ",Trump taps ex-pharma executive Azar as U.S. health secretary

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The judge in the bribery trial of Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey told a jury on Monday to continue deliberating after the panel said it was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, according to defendant’s spokesman. U.S. District Judge William Walls sent the jurors home for the day and told them to resume their deliberations on Tuesday, Steven Sandberg, a representative for Menendez, said in an email.  A representative for the court clerk’s office and the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Menendez is on trial on charges that he accepted private flights, campaign contributions and other bribes from a wealthy patron, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, in exchange for official favors between 2006 and 2013. Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship. If Menendez is convicted, Republicans will be presented with a chance to gain a seat in the closely divided U.S. Senate, as his replacement would be named by Republican Governor Chris Christie. Christie will remain in office until Jan. 16, when Democratic governor-elect Phil Murphy will take his place. The jury, beginning its first day of deliberations with a new member after another panelist was allowed to leave for a previously scheduled vacation, sent the judge a note on Monday afternoon saying they were deadlocked and could not reach a verdict on any of the counts, the Newark Star-Ledger newspaper reported. “Is there any additional guidance and what do we do now?” the jury asked the judge in their note, according to the newspaper.  The judge then heard from attorneys from both the prosecution, who argued that the jury had only begun their deliberations again three hours earlier that day, and Menendez’s attorney, who argued for the judge to declare a mistrial, the Star-Ledger said. Walls concluded that it would be appropriate for the jury to continue their deliberations. If found guilty of all charges, Menendez could face a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a conservative group’s free speech challenge to a Minnesota law prohibiting voters from wearing T-shirts or other apparel adorned with overtly political messages inside polling stations.  A group called the Minnesota Voters Alliance is appealing a lower court’s decision to uphold the law, which forbids political badges, buttons or other insignia inside polling places during primary or general elections. State election officials have interpreted the law as also barring campaign literature and material from groups with political views such as the conservative Tea Party movement or the liberal MoveOn.org. Violators are asked to cover up or remove offending items, but officials are instructed not to bar anyone from voting.  The Minnesota Voters Alliance, a St. Paul-based group that says it seeks to expose voter fraud, and several other organizations sued in 2010 claiming state officials turned polling places into “speech-free zones,” violating the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment protection of freedom of speech.  Other states including Texas, New Jersey and Delaware have regulations similar to Minnesota’s, according to court filings.  The group’s executive director, Andrew Cilek, was temporarily prevented from voting for wearing a T-shirt bearing the Tea Party logo and a button that stated, “Please I.D. Me.” The button was part of a campaign opposing the state’s lack of a photo identification requirement for voting, court papers said. In rulings in 2013 and 2017, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis upheld the Minnesota restrictions, suggesting the law helps maintain “peace, order and decorum” at polling sites.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Pacific Legal Foundation conservative legal group, appealed to the Supreme Court saying a total ban on political speech unrelated to candidates or ballot initiatives is overly broad. The high court has allowed states to ban campaign materials and active vote solicitation at polling places, but not all political speech, the plaintiffs said. “The Supreme Court’s decision to hear the case is a good sign for First Amendment rights,” foundation lawyer Wen Fa said in an email. A spokesman for Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon declined to comment but state officials said in legal papers the law is neutral with respect to individuals’ viewpoints. It was one of two cases the conservative-majority court took up on Monday in which conservative organizations are seeking to vindicate what they consider to be their free speech rights. The other involved a challenge to a California law regarding private facilities that counsel pregnant women against abortion. ",Supreme Court to hear Minnesota voter apparel law challenge
0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two U.S. House Democrats on Monday asked the Federal Communications Commission inspector general to probe whether  FCC Chairman Ajit Pai was biased in favor of Sinclair Broadcast Group, which is seeking approval of a $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co. Representatives Frank Pallone and Elijah Cummings cited FCC decisions that benefited Sinclair, the largest U.S. television broadcast group, and a media report last year that the election campaign of President Donald Trump struck a deal with Sinclair for favorable coverage. “All of these actions – when taken in context with reported meetings between the Trump administration, Sinclair, and Chairman Pai’s office – have raised serious concerns about whether Chairman Pai’s actions comply with the FCC’s mandate to be independent,” the pair wrote. Advocacy group Free Press said in an FCC filing in August that Sinclair forces its stations to “air pro-Trump propaganda and then seeks favors from the Trump administration.”  A spokeswoman for Pai said the “request appears to be part of many Democrats’ attempt to target one particular company because of its perceived political views ... Any claim that Chairman Pai is modifying the rules now to benefit one particular company is completely baseless.” Politico, citing unnamed sources, reported in December that Trump’s campaign made a deal with Sinclair to get favorable coverage in exchange for more access to Trump.  Sinclair did not respond to a request for comment on Monday. FCC Commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democrat, told a congressional committee last month, “All of our media policy decisions seem to be custom-built for this one company.”  Sinclair announced plans in May to acquire Tribune’s 42 TV stations in 33 markets as well as cable network WGN America, extending its reach to 72 percent of American households.    The FCC is set to vote Thursday on Pai’s plan to eliminate the ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market and make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market. Approval would make it easier for Sinclair to acquire more TV stations. The FCC will also vote Thursday on Pai’s proposal to allow broadcasters to use new technology to improve picture quality and allow better reception on mobile phones, but it could force consumers to eventually buy new equipment. Sinclair holds some patents for the TV technology and Rosenworcel said Sinclair and others could profit.    ",House Democrats seek probe of FCC chairman's treatment of Sinclair
0,True,"November 13, 2017 ",politicsNews,"MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday he had made significant progress on trade issues during a fruitful trip across Asia that saw governments roll out red carpets “like nobody has ever seen”. “We’ve made some very big steps with respect to trade, far bigger than anything you know,” Trump told reporters in Manila on the sidelines of a summit with leaders of Southeast Asian and East Asian nations. He did not give details of his achievements on trade matters during a tour that took him to Japan, South Korea, China and Vietnam before his last leg in the Philippines capital. He said a statement would be issued from the White House on Wednesday about North Korea, and on trade, key issues of a trip he described as fruitful. “It was red carpet like nobody, I think, has probably ever seen,” he said. In Vietnam at the weekend, Trump and leaders of Pacific Rim nations agreed to address “unfair trade practices” and “market- distorting subsidies”, a statement that bore the imprint of Trump’s efforts to reshape the global trade landscape. His “America First” vision has upset a traditional consensus favoring multinational trade pacts that China now champions. On the sidelines of the Vietnam meeting, 11 countries kept alive a Trans Pacific trade deal whose future was thrown into doubt when Trump withdrew from it in the name of protecting American jobs. Chinese President Xi Jinping told the summit in Vietnam that Asia-Pacific nations must “uphold multilateralism”, countering Trump’s message that the United States would stay out of trade deals that surrender its sovereignty. Trump, by contrast, blasted the World Trade Organization and multilateral trade deals during his tour.

Biden, who will turn 75 on Nov. 20, declined to seek the Democratic nomination for last year’s presidential election in the wake of his son’s death. He told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that he was not yet ready to enter a political contest. “I honest to God haven’t made up my mind about that,” said Biden, who is promoting his memoir on Beau Biden, who died in 2015 from brain cancer. “Right now I want to focus on the book and I want to focus on winning the off-year elections. “I’m not closing the door,” said Biden, who added that he was in good health. But if he had to act right now, “I would say no because I am just working through a whole lot, I’m getting there and I want to focus on the book.” Biden served as vice president under Democratic former President Barack Obama for two terms but stood aside as the party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump last year. Biden had sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 and 2008 elections. Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate for 36 years, has long given voice to the working class. Although he campaigned for Clinton, he also has been critical after the Democrats’ loss in 2016, which gave Republicans control of the White House in addition to their hold Congress. Biden has criticized Trump in recent weeks, saying he “does not understand governance” and did not take a strong stand against white supremacists after a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.

0,True,"November 12, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the House of Representatives’ tax-writing committee said on Sunday he would not accept elimination of a federal deduction for state and local taxes, opposing a proposal from Senate Republicans that would hike taxes for some middle class Americans. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he guaranteed the deduction would not be entirely scrapped in a  final tax bill that emerges from dueling plans already unveiled by Republicans in the House and the Senate. Asked on “Fox News Sunday” if House Republicans would reject a bid by Senate Republicans to do away with the deduction entirely, Brady said: “That’s what I’m saying.” The deduction for state and local taxes, known as SALT, has been one of the most hotly contested issues as Republicans seek to achieve a significant overhaul of the U.S. tax code and hand President Donald Trump his first major legislative victory. It is a chief concern for a group of House Republicans who face re-election battles next year in high-tax, typically Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. Other sticking points include a proposal by the Senate to delay implementation of a cut in the corporate tax rate and a House plan to eliminate the estate tax on inheritances. Republicans control both the House and the Senate. Lawmakers will debate their respective plans this week before heading home for the Thanksgiving Day holiday. Republicans hope to resolve their differences in time to reach their goal of enacting the legislation by the end of the year. The Senate tax blueprint introduced on Thursday would repeal the SALT deduction entirely. The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for property tax up to $10,000 a year. Brady said there were many similarities in the rival tax proposals. “I know that everyone’s stressing the differences - there are some - but there’s far more common ground,” he said. Both the House and Senate plans would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt, an increase that has worried some fiscally conservative Republicans. Both plans also call for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and would reshape how the United States taxes multinational corporations. They are both widely seen as a boon for business. Congressional Democrats have criticized the Republican plans as lopsided, favoring wealthy Americans and corporate interests. “Both the House and the Senate bills would raise taxes on millions of middle-class families, particularly in the suburbs, while providing a huge giveaway to corporations and the wealthy,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said. “Republicans should go back to the drawing board and fully restore the SALT deduction,” he said in a statement. Some analyses show that some Americans would see a tax increase under both plans. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin acknowledged that on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday, although he said most middle-class families would be better off. “For most people - and, again, it may not be 100 percent, but by far the majority - both the House and Senate version provide middle-income tax relief,” he said. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said both plans adhere to Trump’s two main objectives in overhauling the tax code: a tax cut for middle-income Americans and a deep reduction in the corporate tax rate to make U.S. businesses competitive. “That’s how we’re going to grow the economy. That’s how we’re going to pay for the tax bill,” Cohn said on Fox’s “Sunday Morning Futures.” A report by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated earlier this month that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. Republican Representative Peter King has fiercely opposed the elimination of the SALT deduction, saying many in his home state of New York earning $300,000 a year were hardworking, two-income families facing a very high cost of living. “They’re not hedge fund people,” King said on “Sunday Morning Futures.” “These are hardworking people and they’re going to get screwed by this bill.” ",U.S. House will reject total elimination of state and local tax deductions: Brady
0,True,"November 12, 2017 ",politicsNews,"HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Sunday attempted to clear up confusion over whether he accepts Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials of meddling in the U.S. election last year. At a news conference in Vietnam, Trump distanced himself from remarks he made on Saturday in which he suggested he believed Putin when he said there had been no Russian meddling in the election that took him to the White House. The comments had drawn criticism at home because U.S. intelligence agencies have long since concluded there was Russian meddling. “As to whether I believe it or not, I’m with our agencies, especially as currently constituted,” Trump said at a news conference with Vietnamese President Tran Dai Quang.  “As currently led, by fine people, I believe very much in our intelligence agencies.” He was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. Former U.S. intelligence director James Clapper had told Reuters: “The fact the president of the United States would take Putin at his word over that of the intelligence community is quite simply unconscionable.”  The Russian issue has clouded Trump’s first year in office and his comments on Saturday were a distraction from his    five-nation Asia tour. Trump said he still believed Putin did not think there had been Russian meddling.     “I believe that President Putin really feels, and feels strongly, that he did not meddle in our election,” Trump said, while adding: “What he believes is what he believes.”  Trump said he was not interested in arguing with Putin over meddling and wanted to get on with Russia to work on world problems including North Korea, Syria and Ukraine. Trump has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax. A special counsel, Robert Mueller, is conducting an investigation that has led to charges against Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates. U.S. intelligence agencies have also concluded Russians interfered to tip the election in Trump’s favour through hacking and releasing emails to embarrass Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and spreading social media propaganda.

0,True,"November 12, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two former top U.S. intelligence officials said on Sunday they fear President Donald Trump is being manipulated by Russian President Vladimir Putin, after Trump said he believed Putin was sincere in denying Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Former CIA Director John Brennan and ex-National Intelligence Director James Clapper both said Trump was mishandling Moscow ties even as a special counsel investigates possible collusion between Trump’s campaign team and Russia.     “I think Mr. Trump is, for whatever reason, either intimidated by Mr. Putin, afraid of what he could do, or what might come out as a result of these investigations... It’s either naiveté, ignorance or fear in terms of what Mr. Trump is doing vis-à-vis the Russians,” Brennan said in an appearance with Clapper on CNN’s “State of the Union.”     Clapper added that foreign leaders who roll out the red carpet for Trump are able to manipulate Trump. “I do think both the Chinese and the Russians think they can play him,” Clapper said. Their comments came after Trump told reporters over the  weekend that he had spoken with Putin again over allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election and that the Russian president again denied any involvement. “I really believe that, when he tells me that, he means it,” Trump told reporters. “I think he is very insulted by it, which is not a good thing for our country.” Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on the same show that the criticism leveled against Trump’s management of relations with Russia and China was “ridiculous.” “President Trump is not getting played by anybody,” Mnuchin said.     Trump also took a swipe at Obama-era intelligence officials  Brennan, Clapper and former FBI Director James Comey, calling  them “political hacks” and questioning the findings of a U.S. intelligence report that concluded that Russians sought to tilt  the election in Trump’s favor. Facing sharp criticism, Trump walked back from some of those comments on Sunday, saying he has faith in the intelligence leaders he has hired. Brennan on Sunday called Trump’s criticism of him a “badge of honor,” and Clapper suggested said Trump’s denial of Russian interference in the election “poses a peril to the country.” When asked, Brennan declined to say whether he knows of any intelligence to suggest that the Russians have compromising or damaging information on Trump.

0,True,"November 11, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team has questioned Sam Clovis, co-chairman of President Donald Trump’s election campaign, to  determine if Trump or top aides knew of the extent of the campaign team’s contacts with Russia, two sources familiar with the investigation said on Friday. The focus of the questions put to Clovis by Mueller’s team has not been previously reported. “The ultimate question Mueller is after is whether candidate Trump and then President-elect Trump knew of the discussions going on with Russia, and who approved or even directed them,” said one source. “That is still just a question.”   Clovis testified in late October before the grand jury in Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He is also cooperating with the Senate Intelligence Committee, which is investigating the same issues. Contacted late on Friday, the White House declined to comment. One of the sources described Clovis as “another domino” after former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI over his own contacts with Russians during the 2016 election campaign.  “The investigators now know what Papadopoulos was doing on the Russian front, which he initially tried to conceal, and who he told that to,” said the other source. “Now [they] want to know whether Clovis and others reported these activities and others related to Russia, and if so, to whom,” this source said.  Attorneys for Clovis did not respond to requests for comment. Lawyers for Papadopoulos had no immediate comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. According to court documents related to Papadopoulos’ guilty plea, he reported to Clovis in an email on a March 24, 2016, meeting he had in London with a professor later identified as Joseph Mifsud. Mifsud in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency. The documents showed Clovis responded to the proposed meetings by saying he would “work it through the campaign.” While he told Papadopoulos not to make a commitment then to set up those meetings, he congratulated him for “great work.” In August 2016, after Trump won the Republican presidential nomination, Clovis encouraged Papadopoulos to “make the trip” when Papadopoulos proposed going to an off-the-record meeting with unnamed Russian officials, the court documents show. Victoria Toensing, one of Clovis’s lawyers, said last week her client “always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump and/or the campaign”. After Papadopoulos’ guilty plea, the White House and former Trump campaign officials dismissed Papadopoulos and Clovis as minor figures in the campaign.  The campaign’s National Security Advisory Committee, which Clovis formed, has become a focus of the investigations by both Mueller and the Senate, sources said. “Sam built the first group of eight,” J.D. Gordon, the director of the campaign foreign policy group, told Reuters, adding that he and then-Senator Jeff Sessions, now the U.S. Attorney General, had “nearly doubled” it in size. However, two other sources familiar with the investigations said investigators have been told the committee Clovis formed did very little, and that other advisers appeared to carry more weight with Trump.

Relations between Hanoi and Beijing have been particularly strained since July, when China put pressure on Vietnam to stop oil drilling in a disputed area in the South China Sea. Vietnam’s state television said the Chinese president had told the Vietnamese leader he wanted to work with Southeast Asian nations on a code of conduct in the sea. China’s Xinhua news agency said China and Vietnam had agreed to properly handle maritime issues and strive to maintain peace and stability. Reefs and islands in the South China Sea are disputed by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan as well as China and Vietnam. Since Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has grown closer to China, Vietnam has emerged as China’s main challenger in the area. China’s move to pressure Vietnam to stop oil drilling in a disputed area in July brought relations between the Communist neighbours to a low. Xi and Trump both held bilateral meetings with Vietnamese officials in the wake of a summit of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation in the Vietnamese city of Danang. Trump told Vietnam’s President Tran Dai Quang that he was prepared to mediate between claimants to the South China Sea and said China’s position was a problem.

In a series of tweets he also said Chinese President Xi Jinping was “upping sanctions” on North Korea in response to its nuclear and missile programs and that Xi wanted Pyongyang to “denuclearize.” During Trump’s visit to Beijing last week Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint it would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side by side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. One of Trump’s tweets read: “Why would Kim Jong-un insult me by calling me ‘old,’ when I would NEVER call him ‘short and fat?’ Oh well, I try so hard to be his friend - and maybe someday that will happen!” Speaking later in Vietnam’s capital, Hanoi, Trump said “it would be very, very nice” if he and Kim became friends. “That might be a strange thing to happen but it’s a possibility,” he said. Trump has traded insults and threats with Kim in the past amid escalating tension over Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs as North Korea races toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States -something Trump has vowed to prevent. North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on Sept. 3, prompting another round of U.N. sanctions. In September Kim described Trump as a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard” whom he would tame with fire. His comments came after Trump threatened in his maiden United Nations address to “totally destroy” the country of 26 million people if the United States were threatened. After North Korea’s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho addressed the U.N. General Assembly in September Trump tweeted: “Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won’t be around much longer!” North Korea has conducted dozens of ballistic missile tests in defiance of U.N. sanctions. It has vowed to never give up its weapons programs, saying they are necessary to counter hostility from the United States and its allies. The United States has said that all options, including military, are on the table, although its preference is for a diplomatic solution.

Trudeau, in Manila for a summit of regional leaders, dropped in at an outlet of fastfood giant Jollibee Foods Corp  after a visit to a nearby women’s clinic that advocates family planning, a touchy subject in the Catholic-majority Philippines. He greeted nearly everyone in the store, shaking hands and exchanging hugs with fans after ordering fried chicken and a strawberry float. “Can I get it to go? I’ll eat it in the car,” Trudeau said, before going behind the counter for a photograph with Jollibee staff. Earlier, when he landed at Clark airport, a smiling Trudeau waded into a crowd of children gathered to greet dignitaries arriving for the summit, exchanging high fives and waving to others.  During his last visit to Manila, Trudeau won a Twitter poll with the hashtag #APEChottie that asked people to vote for the most attractive leader at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in 2015. “He’s so handsome! And he’s very nice,” said 29-year-old Rina Aparicio, among the customers at the fastfood outlet. “I asked for a selfie and he said yes right away.” Outside the store, hundreds of people screamed and shouted  as Trudeau got into his car, waving what appeared to be hastily written placards saying “Welcome to the Philippines!” Trudeau visited the first Jollibee store in Winnipeg, Canada in January, a country with hundreds of thousands of Filipino immigrants. Jollibee, a $5 billion company that has been dubbed the McDonald’s of the Philippines, is looking to go global with primary targets including China and the United States.  The company, which also serves burgers and sweet spaghetti, is opening another outlet in Winnipeg this month and plans are to increase that to 30 in five to 10 years, said Jose Minana, a Jollibee executive. Minana said the company did not seek out Trudeau for the visit, and said it was requested by Canadian officials. “We’re very humbled by him taking time from his obviously busy schedule to give us a slice of his time,” said Minana. “I’d like to also think that he enjoys the food.” ",'Can I get it to go?'

Trump and Putin met briefly on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Vietnam on Saturday and agreed on a joint statement supporting a political solution for Syria, but did not hold substantive bilateral talks. “Unfortunately the American side did not offer any alternatives despite all efforts of our Russian colleagues. There was only one time offered that was convenient for the American side, and only one place offered, which had already been rented by the Americans,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency. “The Americans showed no flexibility, and unfortunately did not offer any other alternative proposals. That is why the meeting could not happen,” Peskov added. Putin himself said on Saturday the lack of a bilateral meeting with Trump in Vietnam was due to both leaders’ schedules and protocol obstacles that their teams had been unable to  overcome. Allegations that Trump’s election campaign colluded with Moscow last year to turn voters away from Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton have hampered the president’s efforts to improve frosty U.S.-Russian relations.

Trump later distanced himself from his remarks. According to RIA, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked how Trump had raised the question about alleged Russian meddling, said: “In fact, Trump asked whether that information could be true, how true it could be, and President Putin, for his part, explained his position, which is that Russia did not interfere in any election and this could not be the case.” Putin also said he did not understand “the groundless statements on the issue being made in the United States”, Peskov added.

On Sunday, Trump was careful to make clear he sided with the intelligence agencies under his own leadership. He has previously called the allegations of election campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax. ",Trump asked Putin if allegations of Russian meddling were true: RIA

0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews," LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Convincing big U.S. dairy owners to buy robots to milk their cows - and reduce the farmhands they employ - used to be a tough sell for Steve Fried. Recently, his job has gotten easier, he says, in part because of President Donald Trump.  “I get calls on a daily basis and it typically starts with, ‘I don’t want to deal with this labor headache any more’,” said Fried, sales manager for Lely North America, which makes robotic dairy milking and feeding systems.  Trump’s crackdown on illegal immigration through stepped-up arrests and border enforcement has shaken the U.S. agricultural sector, where as many as 7 in 10 farm workers are undocumented, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation.  In addition, Republican lawmakers in Congress have introduced legislation that would require all employers to check social security numbers against federal databases to ensure their workers are in the country legally, something that is now voluntary in all but a handful of states.  The get-tough approach ""has created a great deal of anxiety,"" said Tom Vilsack, chief executive of the U.S. Dairy Export Council, who was U.S. Agriculture Secretary for eight years under President Barack Obama.    The shift comes as the industry was already struggling to cope with a shrinking, aging workforce. That is ratcheting up pressure on the sector to embrace new technology.  Farmers and food companies increasingly are moving to automate dairy operations, chicken processing, crop production and harvesting. Even delicate crops such as strawberries and peaches are being considered for mechanization.  “You’d be a fool to not have a plan that moves you that way,” said Duff Bevill, who owns a vineyard management company in Sonoma County, California.  Pilgrim’s Pride Corp, (PPC.O) the second largest U.S. chicken producer, this year cited a tightening migrant labor market as key to its decision to invest in robots and X-ray technology for its slaughterhouses. The goal: to swap human hands for machines that can debone the front half of chickens and perform other chores.  “We’re investing heavily in automating our processes, taking labor out and making jobs easier,” Pilgrim’s CEO William Lovette said in an earnings call. He said the company also decided to increases wages.  In Gilroy, California, Christopher Ranch is likewise embracing new machinery. The largest North American producer of fresh garlic, Christopher Ranch will spend about $1 million this year for a new Spanish-made robot in its packing plant that inserts garlic heads into sleeves, according to Ken Christopher, vice president of the family-owned business.  A 2014 report by WinterGreen Research forecast significant growth in the use of robotics in “every aspect of farming, milking, food production” and other agricultural enterprises. The report put the market for agricultural robots at $817 million in 2013 and projected that it would reach $16.3 billion by 2020.  Sensing opportunity, investors are stepping up to address agriculture’s labor squeeze with new automation, helped by falling electronics costs and advancements in software, robotics and artificial intelligence.  Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), this year spearheaded a $10 million investment in Abundant Robotics, which is working on an apple-picking robot. It also participated in a $20 million funding round for Bowery Farming, which uses robotics to grow leafy greens indoors.  Elsewhere, farm machinery maker Deere & Co (DE.N) announced that it spent $305 million to buy precision weed-killing robot maker Blue River Technology. INCENTIVES TO AUTOMATE  While little official data exists to illustrate the impact of Trump’s immigration policies on farm laborers, there is no question that illegal migration is down sharply since he took office in late January.  The number of people caught trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico dropped almost 60 percent between February and May compared the same period last year, according to government figures. Between late January to early September, the number of individuals arrested in the interior of the country by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) rose almost 43 percent over the same period in 2016.  Gary Wishnatzki, a third-generation strawberry farmer in Florida, says scarce labor convinced him to raise $5 million so far to build a robotic strawberry picker that he hopes someday will reduce his industry’s need for field hands.  Bruce Taylor, CEO of Taylor Farms, a Salinas, California producer of salads and chopped vegetables for stores and restaurants, says his company has automated 20 percent of its packing plant.  The company has also teamed with an equipment maker to build a mechanized romaine harvester that is currently in use, and it is exploring automation for iceberg lettuce, broccoli and other field crops, Taylor said.  In the meantime, farmers are raising wages. Data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s most recent farm labor report shows average wages during the week of April 9 to 15 were $13.23 per hour, up 4 percent from the same week a year ago.  “The mantra in agriculture right now is automate what you can and pay well for the labor you absolutely have to have,” said Paul Pittman, CEO of Farmland Partners Inc, (FPI.N) a real estate investment trust that invests in North American farm land.  To win the loyalty of its full-time production workers, garlic grower Christopher Ranch decided to raise pay by 50 percent between 2016 and 2018, getting a four-year jump on California’s mandated $15 minimum wage that will take effect in 2022.  “Companies need to find ways of adapting and adjusting,” Christopher, the executive, said. “We’re going to take a small financial hit, but we’re going to be ready.”  Follow Trump’s impact on energy, environment, healthcare, immigration and the economy at The Trump Effect  www.reuters.com/trump-effect ","As Trump targets immigrants, U.S. farm sector looks to automate"

0,True,"November 11, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Acting Secretary of Homeland Security Elaine Duke on Friday denied reports that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly pressured her to end protections for tens of thousands of immigrants, and said she plans to remain in the Trump administration. The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Kelly pressured Duke to end what is called temporary protected status for tens of thousands of Hondurans living in the United States. The newspaper also reported that Duke has informed Kelly that she plans to resign. The New York Times later reported that Kelly “made an 11th-hour plea” to Duke that she end the protections. “The recent media reports regarding the TPS decision-making process are seriously flawed,” Duke said in a statement late on Friday evening.  She said she had conversations with Kelly, the former secretary of homeland security, leading up to her decision, but that he “consistently reiterated that, as the Acting Secretary, the current decisions were mine to make and should be done in accordance with the existing law.”  “At no time did he pressure me to terminate TPS for Nicaragua, Honduras or El Salvador: any reports otherwise are false,” she added. In the end, Duke extended the benefits for Honduran immigrants until July 2018, though officials said it could then be terminated. Duke decided to end the special status for Nicaraguan immigrants, however, and it will expire in January 2019. Duke said it was “a tremendous honor” to serve at DHS, and said she planned to continue in the department’s second-highest position, deputy secretary, once Kirstjen Nielsen, the nominee for DHS secretary, wins Senate confirmation. “I have no plans to go anywhere and reports to the contrary are untrue,” Duke said. Thousands from both Nicaragua and Honduras were given the special status in 1999 after Hurricane Mitch devastated Central America. In all, temporary protected status protects more than 300,000 people living in the United States. ",Acting DHS chief denies White House pressured her over immigration program
0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The national campaign wing for U.S. Senate Republicans cut fund-raising ties on Friday with Roy Moore, the party’s nominee for a special Senate race in Alabama, a day after sexual misconduct allegations upended his front-runner bid for the seat. The move was the latest sign the Republican establishment, holding onto a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, was abandoning an insurgent candidacy heavily promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump’s former political strategist, Steve Bannon. Meanwhile, Democrats and progressive groups, emboldened by  Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey on Tuesday, sought to capitalize on the accusations in support of the Democratic nominee, former U.S. Attorney Doug Jones. Moore, a controversial former judge and a staunch Christian conservative, was accused by a woman of initiating a sexual encounter in 1979 when she was 14 years old and he was a 32-year-old prosecutor, the Washington Post reported on Thursday. Three other women said he pursued them when they were between the ages of 16 and 18, though none accused him of sexual contact. The 70-year-old Moore again denied any wrongdoing on Friday during an appearance on conservative commentator Sean Hannity’s national radio show. “These allegations are completely false and misleading,” Moore said. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which helps elect Republicans to the Senate, filed paperwork with federal election officials on Friday severing its fund-raising relationship with Moore for the special election on Dec. 12. Numerous prominent Republicans have either called on Moore to drop out immediately, as Arizona Senator John McCain did on Thursday, or said he should do so if the allegations prove true, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. “Moore is unfit for office and should step aside,” former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney said Friday on Twitter. Senator Mike Lee of Utah, who initially took the same stance as McConnell, tweeted on Friday that could “no longer endorse” Moore’s candidacy, after reading “the detailed description of the incidents, as well as the response from Judge Moore and his campaign.” Senator Steve Daines of Montana likewise said he was pulling his endorsement. But several Alabama Republican officials did not waver in their support of Moore, who scored a decisive primary victory in September over Luther Strange, the incumbent appointed to fill the seat on an interim basis when Jeff Sessions was named U.S. attorney general.  The race had been seen as a long shot for Democrats in Alabama, which has not elected a Democratic senator in a quarter century. Jones was trailing by double digits in some opinion polls. Following publication of the Washington Post story, several Democratic senators, including liberal Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, sent email blasts to donors, soliciting more support for Jones’ campaign. The Democratic Party has been coordinating with Jones behind the scenes, wary of providing overt support such as television advertising in the deeply Republican state. Progressive groups MoveOn, Democracy for America and Indivisible expect the allegations against Moore to boost their grassroots efforts to engage Democratic voters in Alabama. “We were planning to go bigger already,” said Matt Blizek, a mobilization coordinator for MoveOn. “With the news and the fact that this is a close race, that’s only going to increase.” A win for Jones could transform the political picture in Washington, narrowing the Republican majority down to just one vote. Moore has come back from controversy before. He was twice forced out of his position as the state’s chief justice, once for refusing to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the courthouse and once for defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Democrats have highlighted his penchant for incendiary statements about Muslims and homosexuality. Zac McCrary, a veteran Democratic pollster based in Birmingham, Alabama, said he now sees Jones as the favorite. “Roy Moore had much less margin for error than a Republican does traditionally in Alabama,” McCrary said.  But Jonathan Gray, a Republican consultant in Alabama, said voters were already questioning the veracity of the Washington Post story, given its timing. The only development that could sink Moore’s candidacy is a write-in campaign from a Republican backed by the party, he said. Absent that, he said, all the analysis in the world will not change a simple fact: “Roy Moore wins December 12.” ",Republican establishment bails on Alabama candidate after sex allegations
0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The lawyer for former U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn on Friday labeled as “outrageous” and “false” media reports suggesting his client may have been involved in an alleged plan to seize a Muslim cleric and deliver him to Turkey in exchange for millions of dollars. The rare statement from lawyer Robert Kelner came after the Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that Special Counsel Robert Mueller was investigating an alleged proposal under which Flynn and his son would receive up to $15 million for seizing Fethullah Gulen from his U.S. home and delivering him to the Turkish government. The Journal cited people familiar with the investigation. NBC also reported on Friday about an alleged December 2016 meeting, saying Mueller’s team was investigating whether Flynn met with senior Turkish officials in the weeks before President Donald Trump’s January 2017 inauguration about a possible quid pro quo in which Flynn would be paid to do the bidding of Turkey’s government while in office. NBC cited multiple people familiar with the probe. “Out of respect for the process of the various investigations regarding the 2016 campaign, we have intentionally avoided responding to every rumor or allegation raised in the media,” Kelner said in an emailed statement.   “But today’s news cycle has brought allegations about General Flynn, ranging from kidnapping to bribery, that are so outrageous and prejudicial that we are making an exception to our usual rule: they are false.” The Wall Street journal reported that the alleged plan involving Flynn and Turkish officials emerged during Mueller’s wider investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and any collusion by the Trump campaign. Flynn was fired by Trump after just 24 days in the job for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with then Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year. Barry Coburn, a lawyer for Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., declined to comment. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup. A spokesman for Mueller’s team declined to comment on the report on Friday. Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with Kislyak and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for work he did for a Turkish businessman. The Journal reported that FBI agents asked at least four people about a December meeting in New York where Flynn and  Turkish government representatives discussed removing Gulen, citing people with knowledge of the FBI’s inquiries.  NBC also reported that investigators had questioned witnesses about an alleged December meeting between Flynn and Turkish officials where Gulen was discussed. The group also discussed how to set free a Turkish-Iranian gold trader, Reza Zarrab. Zarrab is in prison in the United States on federal charges that he helped Iran skirt U.S. sanctions, NBC said. A Reuters report on Oct. 26 said one of Flynn’s business associates, former CIA Director James Woolsey, pitched a $10 million contract to two Turkish businessmen to help discredit Gulen while Woolsey was an adviser to Trump’s election campaign. Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website. Mueller’s team has also interviewed White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, the highest-level Trump aide known to have spoken with investigators, CNN reported on Thursday.

0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Unease among Republicans about a massive increase in the federal deficit could complicate passage of two tax-cut bills working their way through the U.S. Congress, endangering President Donald Trump’s top legislative priority. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan budget watchdog in Washington, on Friday called a Senate Republican tax plan a “fatally flawed budget buster,” likening it to Republican legislation in the House of Representatives that the House tax committee has approved. Both measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the annual budget deficit and the $20 trillion national debt, according to congressional tax analysts. The watchdog group estimated that $900 billion of the projected $1.5 trillion deficit increase would come from business tax cuts. The remainder would come from individual tax cuts, including a cut in the estate tax on inheritance that would help only the richest Americans, it said. Republicans hold a tenuous 52-48 majority in the Senate. For that reason, if they lose the support of only three senators from their ranks, they cannot pass a tax bill as long as Democrats stay united in their opposition. Nearly 10 months into his presidency, with his party in control of the House and the Senate, Trump is still without a major legislative victory. Failing to get a tax bill through the Senate could cost Republicans in November 2018’s midterm elections. The Tax Foundation, another nonpartisan group, said the Senate plan would add $1.78 trillion to the deficit over a decade. It estimated that over the same time frame lower taxes would expand the U.S. economy by 3.7 percent, add 925,000 full-time jobs, raise wages by 2.9 percent and generate enough new tax revenue to erase all but $516 billion of the deficit effect.  For decades, Republicans positioned themselves as deficit hawks, refusing to raise the debt limit, opposing Democratic spending programs and warning of crushing federal debts being passed on to future generations of Americans. The tax plans now being debated represent a stark reversal, with congressional Republican leadership and tax law writers urging passage of deficit-expanding tax changes. Only a handful of Republican senators already have publicly voiced misgivings. After the Senate plan was released on Thursday, Republican Senator Jeff Flake said in a statement, “I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes, while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy.” Senator James Lankford said in a statement, “As we work on tax relief, we must also not lose sight of our responsibilities to protect the nation, provide basic government services and confront our federal debt.” Senator Bob Corker, another Republican and a critic of Trump, did not comment after the Senate bill’s release but signaled fiscal concerns after the House issued its plan, saying he did not want tax cut legislation that added to the deficit. “The current tax reform debate shows Congress just can’t seem to shake its addiction to debt,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. “If tax cuts paid for by debt are signed into law, Congress will have sent a massive, budget-busting tax bill to our children to pay, and it will result only in a short-term sugar high with little to no economic improvement over the long term,” she said. The House is due to vote on passage of its tax bill next week. The Senate Finance Committee is due to begin formal consideration of the Senate’s version on Monday. The Senate panel’s chairman, Republican Orrin Hatch, said he hopes to have the bill approved and sent to the full Senate by the end of next week. The House and Senate would need to agree on a single piece of legislation, pass it and send it to Trump for his signature. ",Deficit worries complicate path for Republican tax cuts

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republicans unveiled a tax plan on Thursday that differed from the House of Representatives’ version on several key fronts, including how they treat the corporate tax rate, the tax deduction for state and local taxes, and the estate tax. Complicating a Republican push for the biggest overhaul of U.S. tax law since the 1980s, senators said that, like the House, they wanted to slash the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, but in 2019, not right away. The House was set to vote on its measure next week after its tax-writing Ways and Means Committee approved the legislation on Thursday along party lines, with Democrats united in opposition. The Senate’s timetable was less clear, with a formal bill yet to be drafted in that chamber, where Republicans have a much smaller majority and a narrower path to winning approval for any legislation, let alone one as contentious as a tax package.  As President Donald Trump toured Asia, Republicans reiterated their goal of enacting final legislation by the end of the year. If that happens, it would be Trump’s first major legislative accomplishment since he took office in January. Stocks, which have rallied this year on hopes for business tax cuts, declined as details of the two plans emerged. Investors worried about divergence between the House and Senate and the Senate’s proposed corporate tax rate cut delay. In a broad sense, the House and Senate plans matched up in calling for deep tax cuts for high-earners and businesses and for a dramatic reshaping of how the United States taxes multinational corporations, big winners if the plans become law. Democrats, largely ignored in the closed-door drafting of both bills, have condemned them as giveaways to the rich and businesses that will do little for ordinary Americans. White House economic adviser Gary Cohn handed them ammunition in comments in a CNBC interview, saying: “The most excited group out there are big CEOs, about our tax plan.” The White House issued statements that praised the Ways and Means Committee and the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee and expressed confidence that further progress would be made. ELECTION WAKE-UP Victories by Democrats in state and local elections in Virginia, New Jersey and elsewhere on Tuesday increased the urgency for Republicans, who control both the White House and Congress, to make good on their campaign promises on taxes.  “We’re going to get this over the finish line,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said, adding the House would not just approve whatever the Senate passes and that a House-Senate conference committee would be needed to reconcile differences. One big disagreement between the two chambers concerns a  deduction now available to Americans for state and local taxes (SALT), a keen concern for taxpayers in high-tax, typically Democratic-leaning states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts. The Senate plan would entirely repeal the SALT deduction. The House bill would repeal it only for state and local income and sales tax, but preserve it for property tax up to $10,000. Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer of New York said repealing the SALT deduction and other parts of the Republican proposals would hurt middle- and upper-middle-class Americans. “Passing this plan won’t help Republicans climb out of the hole they are in ... This bill could be your political doom,” he said on the floor of the Senate, where Republicans will need to be especially united given their slim 52-48 majority. Another point of friction is the estate tax on inheritances. The Senate would leave it on the books, but increase exemptions so fewer people pay. The House would increase exemptions, but repeal the tax over a six-year period. The Senate calls for keeping the existing seven tax brackets and cutting the top tax rate for the highest-earning taxpayers to 38.5 percent from 39.6 percent. The House wants to reduce the number of brackets, but leave the 39.6 percent top rate alone. The Senate would close a loophole that allows private-equity fund managers and other wealthy Wall Street financiers to pay the capital gains tax rate on “carried interest” income, instead of the higher wage rate. The House plan leaves the tax break in place, but further restricts who can claim it. In another divide that will need bridging, both chambers call for slapping a mandatory tax on $2.6 trillion in foreign profits being held offshore by U.S. multinationals. The Senate wants that tax to be 12 percent for cash and liquid assets, and 5 percent for non-liquid assets. The House amended its bill on Thursday, going to 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively.     Tweaks to both bills were expected to continue in days ahead as lobbyists descend on Capitol Hill seeking favors. Both the House and Senate measures would add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the budget deficit and national debt, a problem that not long ago would have drawn Republican criticism. “It turns out that deficit hawks are extinct in the Republican Party,” California’s Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said in a statement. In the Senate’s case, the $1.5 trillion figure is the most by which the legislation is permitted to add to the deficit in order to allow Republicans to use a procedural maneuver known as reconciliation and pass the bill with a simple majority. Estimates released on Thursday evening by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation had the Senate proposal falling within that upper limit, although the bill has yet to be codified into legislative language.

0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The U.S wind energy industry on Friday cheered a Senate tax proposal that, unlike the House version unveiled last week, preserves the tax credit that helps wind farms compete with plants fired by fossil fuels. The Senate plan brought relief to an industry that has spent the last week warning lawmakers on Capitol Hill that changes to the credit would put $50 billion in planned investment at risk. However, if the House and Senate pass their differing proposals on the Republicans’ broad tax-cut plan, a House-Senate committee will need to reconcile the differences and both chambers will have to approve the resulting compromise legislation, so it is too soon to know if the tax overhaul will ultimately preserve the wind energy credit. MidAmerican Energy said on Thursday that if the bill passed as the House proposed, the Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) unit could be forced to cancel $4.3 billion of wind investments in Iowa, affecting 400 jobs and prompting the loss of $10 million a year in property tax and landowner payments. The wind industry’s production tax credit was extended by Congress in 2015 and awards a credit for every kilowatt-hour of energy produced from wind projects. Investors and project developers had banked on the stability of the policy, which is scheduled to phase out by 2020, in planning their investments. “The Senate tax reform bill keeps a promise to America’s more than 100,000 wind energy workers and restores the confidence of businesses pouring billions of dollars into rural America,” Tom Kiernan, Chief Executive of the American Wind Energy Association trade group said in a statement. Republican Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa, John Thune of South Dakota and Dean Heller of Nevada and others were opposed to changes in the tax credit, the AWEA said.

0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump lauded his Beijing meetings on trade and North Korea as “very productive”, ending a visit which Chinese media declared set a “new blueprint” for handling ties, even as the White House looks set for tougher action on China. Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but also praised Xi’s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms.  Hours after Trump left Beijing on Friday, China said it would drop foreign ownership limits on local banks and asset management companies while loosening stake restrictions in securities firms and insurers - moves that have been long awaited by foreign financial firms. Beijing faces intensifying pressure from Western governments and business lobbies to remove investment barriers and other rules that hobble overseas firms from operating in the country, as well as intellectual property theft. Washington has refrained from pushing harder on trade because it needs China’s cooperation on North Korea, although Xi, at least in public, went no further than reiterating China’s determination to achieve denuclearization through talks. Trump and Xi, who call themselves friends, also oversaw the signing of about $250 billion in commercial deals, a show that some in the U.S. business community and others say detracts from addressing structural impediments that puts them at a disadvantage to Chinese rivals. China may be mistaken in thinking it had done enough to address U.S. concerns, and Trump could find people disappointed at home he didn’t make more progress on items like market access and North Korea, Paul Haenle, Director of the Carnegie–Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, said. “My concern is you may see a shift towards a much harder line coming from the U.S. administration. That will be a huge surprise to China and President Xi, especially given that Xi likely feels he has done a lot for Trump on this visit.” Trump reiterated in a tweet just before leaving Beijing for the APEC summit of Asia Pacific leaders in Vietnam that he didn’t blame China for the trade gap between the two countries, adding that he had “very productive” meetings on trade and North Korea with Xi. “I don’t blame China, I blame the incompetence of past Admins for allowing China to take advantage of the U.S. on trade leading up to a point where the U.S. is losing $100’s of billions. How can you blame China for taking advantage of people that had no clue? I would’ve done same!” A U.S. industry source said the implication of Trump blaming his predecessors for the trade deficit is that Trump won’t make the same mistake - a warning to Xi, not a capitulation.  The Trump administration did not bring hard trade policy items to the discussion with Xi because U.S. officials don’t want to “argue over crumbs”, the source added. “Barring some dramatic action on North Korea by Xi, there is going to be a hard turn in U.S. trade policy,” the source said. A second source, who is close to the business delegation that traveled to Beijing this week, added that the Trump administration appeared poised to take a much harder line in the weeks ahead. There were no obvious gaffes during the two-night stopover, and Trump and Xi seemed to enjoy being in each other’s company. At a banquet on Thursday night in the Great Hall of the People, Trump and Xi dined on coconut chicken soup, spicy chicken, stewed beef with tomatoes and grouper fillets. Chinese state media said the tone and outcome of Trump’s visit had been largely positive, saying Trump and Xi were setting a new blueprint for handling relations and managing their differences.   “China has tried its utmost, even at the sacrifice of Sino-North Korean relations,” influential tabloid the Global Times wrote in its editorial.  “Trump has gradually learned that Beijing is indeed making selfless contributions to promoting the denuclearization of the peninsula.

As with previous first ladies, Melania has used her platform to champion public causes, such as the prevention of childhood bullying and combating the opioid epidemic in the United States. Playing a prominent supporting role on the president’s multi-leg Asia visit, she won praise on Chinese social media, with comparisons to China’s glamorous first lady, Peng Liyuan, and comments on her apparent ease in navigating the ancient cobblestones of the Forbidden City in super-high stilettos upon arrival in Beijing on Wednesday. Accompanied by Peng, Melania watched a cultural performance, painted pandas and participated in a cooking class at a primary school on Thursday.     Many on China’s Twitter-like Weibo applauded Melania’s grace and sense of style, as well as her cultural sensitivity.   In China, she wore mostly austere coats and dark gowns from Dolce & Gabbana and Alexander McQueen, in contrast with her magenta Delpozo outfit and electric-blue heels upon landing in South Korea days before.  But most in China said they remained bigger fans of their own first lady, often affectionately referred to online as Peng Mama, which roughly translates as Mother Peng. “I still think Mama oozes more grace, while also exuding a motherly air!” one Weibo poster said. Chinese social media sites are policed more heavily than normal during important political events, with negative or sensitive matter swiftly blocked or removed by internet censors.  As Trump departed, he said on Twitter his wife’s next stop would be Alaska, where she would “greet our AMAZING troops”. However, Trump’s daughter and adviser Ivanka, who is very popular in China, did not accompany her father, to the disappointment of fans. ",First lady Melania plays tourist as Trump departs Beijing
0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A woman has accused Roy Moore, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old and he was 32, the Washington Post reported on Thursday, prompting top Republicans to say he should step aside if the allegations prove true. Moore, 70, the state’s former chief judge, vehemently denied the allegations, calling them “completely false and a desperate political attack.” U.S. President Donald Trump would want Moore to step aside if the allegations against him are true, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said on Friday. “Like most Americans, the president believes we cannot allow a mere allegation, in this case one from many years ago, to destroy a person’s life,” Sanders said. “However, the president also believes that if these allegations are true, Judge Moore will do the right thing and step aside,” she said, as Trump arrived in Vietnam on his 12-day Asia tour.   In a series of Twitter posts later in the day, Moore cast the published allegations against him part of a bid to “silence and shut up Christian conservatives like you and me,” adding “I will NEVER GIVE UP the fight!” Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, working with a slim 52-48 majority, called on Moore to drop out of the race “if these allegations are true.” Several other Republicans, including Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, and Utah Senator Mike Lee, all of whom endorsed Moore, echoed that sentiment. At least two Republican senators, John McCain of Arizona and John Thune of South Dakota, said Moore should step aside immediately, with McCain calling the accusations “deeply disturbing and disqualifying.” Leigh Corfman, now 53, told the Post she met Moore at a courthouse in 1979 when Moore offered to keep her company on a bench outside of a hearing room while her mother was inside for child custody proceeding. Moore, at the time an assistant district attorney, asked for the girl’s phone number and days later took her to his house, where they engaged in sexual activity before she asked to be taken home, Corfman said. The story also quoted three other women who said Moore dated them when they were between 16 and 18 years of age and he was in his early 30s, though none said they had sexual contact with Moore.  Reuters was unable to independently confirm the allegations. The Moore campaign accused the Post of colluding with Democrats to tarnish his reputation with false accusations.  The Post said none of the women had donated to or worked for Moore’s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or for his Republican primary rivals, and that Corfman said she had voted for Republicans in the past three presidential elections, including for Donald Trump in 2016.  Moore has consistently led in polls over Jones. He was considered a heavy favorite in deeply Republican Alabama in the Dec. 12 special election to fill the seat of U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions. It remains to be see whether Thursday’s allegations can buoy Jones’ long-shot bid, which would represent a major upset for Democrats and narrow Republicans’ current edge in the Senate.  Jones’ campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Post story. No matter what happens, Moore will remain on the ballot on Dec. 12 since a candidate’s name cannot be removed within 76 days of the election, according to the office of Alabama’s secretary of state. If, however, the state party tells election officials that it wants to withdraw its nominee, or if Moore himself decided to do so, election officials would not certify any votes cast for Moore. Write-in candidates are also allowed under state law. Alabama political strategist David Mowery, who has worked for candidates of both parties, said the chance of Moore bowing out of the race was “less than zero,” and that it was almost as improbable for state party officials to abandon him in favor of a last-minute write-in candidate. Mowery cited Moore’s overwhelming popularity with Alabama’s Republican voters, who he said would tend to distrust allegations published in the Post. Nevertheless, he said Democrats would seize on the scandal to boost fund-raising. Moore, who has made his moral and religious beliefs the heart of his pitch to voters, prevailed over several Republican opponents in a closely contested primary that saw Trump, McConnell and most Senate Republicans support the incumbent who had been appointed to Sessions’ seat, Luther Strange. The race exposed rifts between the Republican Party’s conservative base and its Washington-based establishment. Moore’s candidacy was heavily promoted by former Trump strategist Steve Bannon, who has vowed to support grassroots challengers next year to take on Republican incumbents. On several occasions, Moore has made controversial statements and taken positions that have cost him his job. He has condemned homosexuality and said he believes some U.S. communities are living under Islamic religious law. He first became a national figure in the early 2000s, when he lost his position as Alabama chief justice after refusing a court order to remove a Ten Commandments monument from outside the courthouse. After winning his position back in 2012, he was again forced out after defying the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage by ordering probate judges not to give marriage licenses to same-sex couples. On his Senate campaign website, Moore said he was suspended “for upholding the sanctity of marriage as between one man and one woman.” ",Republican Senate candidate Moore hit by sexual misconduct allegations
0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton on Thursday urged a state lawmaker accused of sexual harassment to step down, the latest fallout from a growing chorus of harassment allegations gripping U.S. statehouses. Minnesota state Senator Dan Schoen faced growing pressure to resign Thursday after local media reported allegations he made unwanted sexual advances toward women. Schoen could not be reached Thursday, but denied inappropriate contact in a statement to local media. “Women are far too familiar with harassment and it must stop,” Minnesota state Representative Erin Maye Quade said in a statement Thursday. “As a candidate, I experienced it with Sen. Schoen, as a legislator, I’ve experienced it by multiple members of the majority and reported it.” Since allegations of harassment and assault surfaced against movie producer Harvey Weinstein, a revived “MeToo” social media campaign has galvanized women to speak out about instances of sexual harassment by lawmakers at a number of state capitols. Weinstein has denied the claims first reported by the New York Times and the New Yorker magazine. California’s Senate last month hired a law firm to investigate after female legislators, staff and lobbyists in a letter called out a culture of harassment. In Kentucky, Republican House Speaker Jeff Hoover stepped down on Sunday from his leadership post after reports he had settled a sex harassment claim with a woman on his staff. Hoover’s office did not respond to request for comment but he has told the Courier-Journal he engaged in consensual banter.     “Most women I’ve talked to feel like they’ve had some experience of sexual harassment,” Illinois Democratic State Senator Heather Steans said on Wednesday, the day that state legislature began sexual harassment training in the wake of an October open letter similar to California’s calling out pervasive harassment.  “Every industry has its own version of the casting couch. Illinois politics is no exception,” the Illinois letter said. Steans on Thursday announced the formation of a new women’s caucus to focus on harassment and other women’s issues.   “There’s a lot of anger coming forward, that this just has to stop, she said. While sexual harassment allegations in state politics are not new, the concerted public pushback by women could lead to more efforts to strengthen statehouse harassment protections, said Jean Sinzdak, associate director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. About 37 state legislatures in 2016 had formal policies for legislative employees on sexual harassment, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. But experts said they varied in effectiveness and enforcement. ",Chorus of sexual harassment allegations spreads among U.S. statehouses

0,True,"November 10, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit told U.S. election regulators in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday that it “strongly supports” tightening rules on online political advertising as part of efforts to curtail “foreign abuse and influence” in elections. Federal lawmakers have criticized Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc for not doing enough to identify and block Russian agents from buying ads on their services. U.S. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections. In September, the Federal Election Commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. It opened a public comment period that is set to expire Monday. In the letter, Google on Thursday offered its formal response to the FEC’s deliberation.  “Now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in U.S. elections,” the company wrote.  The stance marks an about-face from 2010 when Google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. The commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time. Google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to TV and print ads to the Web. “Google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.” The company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the Internet.  Ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as RT, a Russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on Facebook and Google’s YouTube service. In its letter, Google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. In addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible.  Technology news website Recode first reported the Google letter.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The man accused of tackling U.S. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and breaking his ribs as he was mowing his lawn pleaded not guilty on Thursday to a misdemeanor assault charge, a court official said. Rene Boucher, 59, waived the formal reading of the charge at a hearing in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Warren County Attorney Amy Milliken said by telephone. Boucher, the Republican senator’s neighbor, is charged with fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, for which he faces up to a year in jail if convicted. A pretrial hearing was set for Nov. 30. Paul, 54, told police that Boucher came onto his property in a gated community near Bowling Green and tackled him from behind, the Bowling Green Daily News reported, citing an arrest warrant.  Paul said on Twitter on Wednesday that he suffered six broken ribs and that X-rays showed a pleural effusion, which is a buildup of fluid in the tissues that line the lungs and the chest. The Kentucky State Police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are investigating last Friday’s incident, Milliken said.  Citing unnamed sources, Fox News reported on Thursday that Paul had been told federal charges were expected in the case. The senator’s office did not immediately reply to a request for comment on that possibility. Matt Baker, Boucher’s attorney, was not immediately available to comment.  Baker told Bowling Green television station WBKO that the incident was related to a property dispute and called the idea that Paul was “blindsided” an unfair characterization. Baker also told the TV station that politics was not a motivating factor in the dispute. Media reports have said Boucher, also a physician like Paul, had a long-running dispute with the senator.  Milliken said Boucher’s $7,500 bond requiring him to keep a distance of at least 1,000 feet (305 m) between himself and Paul remained in effect.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Proposals from U.S. Republicans to repeal or restrict a popular deduction on federal income tax for state and local tax (SALT) payments would hit Americans in high-tax states. The 10 states with the highest taxes are represented in the Senate by Democrats, and by Vermont’s Bernie Sanders, an independent who votes with Democrats. A Senate tax plan about to be unveiled on Thursday was expected to propose ending the SALT deduction entirely. An earlier House plan would sharply curtail the deduction. If left unchanged, the Senate plan’s SALT provision would make it harder to attract what could be necessary support for the tax bill from Democratic senators, as it would disproportionately hurt their constituents. Republicans have a 52-48 majority in the chamber, meaning they can afford to lose only two Republican votes and so could be looking for some Democratic support for passage.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A tax plan by U.S. Senate Republicans released on Thursday diverges in several ways from legislation being pushed by Republicans in the House of Representatives, complicating Republican efforts to fulfill their goal of overhauling the tax code by the end of the year. Here are the major provisions that differ significantly. CORPORATE RATE: The House plan would immediately cut the  corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. The Senate would set the same rate, but delay it by one year. CARRIED INTEREST: The Senate leaves unchanged a loophole that allows private-equity fund managers and other wealthy Wall Street financiers to pay the capital gains tax rate instead of the higher income tax rate on their “carried interest” income. The House version narrows the loophole by requiring investments to be held for more than three years instead of one year currently in order to qualify for capital gains treatment. NET OPERATING LOSSES: The Senate version eliminates the carry-back and carry-forward tax strategies by businesses to reduce past and future tax liabilities using net operating losses. The House version tightens the rules around their use. PASS-THROUGHS: The House caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the current top rate on “pass-through” income of up to 39.6 percent. The Senate version has no special pass-through rate but allows business owners to deduct about 17.4 percent of business income from individual taxes. That translates to a 30 percent tax rate for high-income filers. REPATRIATION OF OVERSEAS EARNINGS: The Senate imposes a tax of 12 percent for liquid assets and 5 percent for illiquid. The House sets the rates at 14 percent and 7 percent, respectively. TAX BRACKETS: The Senate version maintains seven tax brackets, with the top bracket’s rate at 38.5 percent. The House has four brackets with the top one unchanged from current levels at 39.6 percent and lifts qualifying income on that top rate to more than $1 million. MORTGAGE INTEREST DEDUCTION: The House caps the deduction of interest payments on mortgages of up to $500,000, and only on a primary residence. The Senate version keeps the existing limit at $1 million but eliminates the deduction of interest on home-equity loans.   DEDUCTING STATE AND LOCAL TAXES: The Senate bill repeals the state and local tax deduction entirely. The House version repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales tax and caps the deduction for state and local property tax paid at $10,000.  STANDARD DEDUCTION: The two versions are in line with each other, with a standard deduction of $12,200 for individuals and $24,000 for married couples, nearly double the current  levels. CHILD TAX CREDIT: The Senate would expand the child tax credit to $1,650 from $1,000. The House version sets it at  $1,600.  INHERITANCES: While the House wants to double the exemption on inherited assets and repeal the tax over a period of six years, the Senate only wants to double the exemption.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans are more likely to believe the wealthy will benefit most from the tax reform currently being pushed in the U.S. Congress by Republicans who insist their goal is to help the middle class, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll released on Thursday.  The poll found 32 percent of Americans think the wealthy will benefit most, compared to 14 percent who think all Americans will benefit and 14 percent who think large U.S. corporations will benefit most.  Congress is working to try to enact the most sweeping overhaul of the tax code since the 1980s that would lower taxes for millions of individual tax payers and slash the rate paid by corporations. The proposal would also eliminate most individual tax deductions, a move that could result in some taxpayers seeing an increase in their total bill to the government while others see a decrease. Despite an insistence by Republicans that their goal is help the middle class, only 8 percent of Americans think that demographic will benefit the most, the poll, which was conducted Nov. 3-8, found.  Republicans and Democrats are divided on who they think tax reform would help the most. Among Republicans, 26 percent think all Americans will benefit, followed by 16 percent who think the wealthy will benefit most, the poll found.  But among Democrats, 46 percent think that wealthy will benefit most, with only 7 percent thinking all Americans will benefit and 17 percent who think corporations will benefit. And while those polled did not think that the middle class will benefit most, an overwhelming majority thought that they should.  The poll found 79 percent think its more important to cut taxes for the middle class than for corporations, and 76 percent think its more important to cut taxes for the poor than for corporations.  However, 76 percent said it was more important to cut taxes for corporations than it was to cut taxes for the wealthy. When it comes to specific changes, the poll found that 46 percent of Americans oppose limiting the mortgage interest deduction, compared to 35 percent who support the change.  The strongest opposition came to the Republican proposal to eliminate deductions for medical expenses, with 54 percent saying they are against the change and 32 percent saying they support it.     The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in early November online in English throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,608 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The same political research firm that prepared a dossier on Trump campaign ties to Russia had unrelated information on Clinton Foundation donors that a Russian lawyer obtained and offered to President Donald Trump’s eldest son last year, three sources familiar with the matter said. The White House and Republican lawmakers have attacked the firm, Fusion GPS, over the dossier compiled by a former British spy that is central to investigations in Congress and by a special counsel into conclusions by U.S. spy agencies that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election and wanted to help Trump win. The sources told Reuters that the negative information that Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya wanted to give to Republican Trump’s campaign at a June 2016 meeting in New York had been dug up by Fusion GPS in an unrelated investigation. Trump’s congressional supporters have suggested that because Fusion also conducted research for lawyers representing a Russian firm in the unrelated matter, the dossier was part of a Russian campaign to help Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Trump backers call the 35-page report a “dodgy dossier” financed by Clinton supporters. Russia has repeatedly denied allegations of meddling in the U.S. election and Trump denies any collusion between his campaign and Moscow officials.       In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, Veselnitskaya said she went to the Trump Tower meeting with Donald Trump Jr., his brother-in-law Jared Kushner, and top campaign adviser Paul Manafort to show them proof of tax evasion by major Democratic donors. She said Donald Jr. asked her for written evidence that illegal funds went to Clinton’s campaign, Bloomberg reported.  Emails made public earlier this year by Trump Jr. showed that a publicist for the son of one of his father’s Russian business contacts helped introduce Veselnitskaya and advised him that she and her associates had “sensitive” information that could damage Clinton. “I love it,” Trump Jr. responded, according to the emails.  In December, 2014, the sources said, Veselnitskaya, who then was involved in litigation pitting her Russian client against British-American financier William Browder, received a legal research memo reporting that the Ziff Brothers, two New York financiers allied with Browder, had made a large contribution to a Clinton charity. The memo had been prepared by Fusion, which had been hired to conduct legal research on Browder by Baker and Hostetler law firm. The firm represented Russian businessman Denis Katsyv, who was engaged in disputes with Browder and U.S. prosecutors. Glenn Simpson, one of Fusion GPS’ founders, met with Veselnitskaya about that litigation before and after her meeting with Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort, according to a source familiar with the matter.  However, a source familiar with 10 hours of testimony Simpson gave the Senate Judiciary committee in August said he told investigators he did not know of Veselnitskaya’s Trump Tower meeting until reports of it appeared in the media. Representatives of the Judiciary Committee’s Republican majority did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesman for Manafort declined to comment. Representatives for Trump Jr. and Kushner could not immediately be reached for comment and neither could a U.S.-based lawyer for Veselnitskaya.  Two sources said the Fusion GPS work for Baker and Hostetler that produced the information Veselnitskaya offered Trump Jr. and his associates was unrelated to the firm’s work for Perkins Coie, a law firm that represented the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s campaign.  Perkins Coie has acknowledged that it paid $1.02 million to Fusion for research related to Donald Trump and his campaign. ","Trump, Clinton camps both offered slice of dossier firm's work: sources"
0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence expressed “deep concern” to Turkey’s prime minister on Thursday about the arrests of American citizens and local staff of U.S. missions in Turkey, the White House said. The matters raised by Pence are some of the issues that have created tension between the two NATO allies in recent months, along with a dispute over a Turkish cleric living in the United States whom Ankara accuses of orchestrating a failed military coup in Turkey last year. In a White House meeting with Prime Minister Binali Yildirim, Pence voiced “deep concern over the arrests of American citizens, Mission Turkey local staff, journalists, and members of civil society under the state of emergency and urged transparency and due process in the resolution of their cases,” the White House said in a statement. In May, a translator at the U.S. consulate in the province of Adana in southern Turkey was arrested. More recently, a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration worker was detained in Istanbul. Both are accused of links to last year’s coup attempt. The U.S. embassy has said the accusations are baseless. Before leaving for the United States, Yildirim had said Turkey’s demand for the United States to hand over cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in Pennsylvania since 1999, would be discussed during his visit. U.S. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order Gulen’s extradition. Another issue to be raised, Yildirim had said, was the fate of some Turkish citizens arrested in the United States - a reference to a wealthy gold trader who was arrested over Iran sanctions evasion last year and an executive at a state-owned bank arrested this year. The White House statement made no mention of any discussions about either subject. It said the two officials “expressed hope that their meeting would help to usher in a new chapter in U.S.-Turkey relations and agreed on the need for constructive dialogue, as friends and allies, on bilateral challenges.” Pence reaffirmed the “enduring strategic partnership” between the two countries and stressed the U.S. commitment to stand with Turkey against the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) “and other terrorist threats.” The United States partially resumed issuing visas in Turkey on Monday after getting what it said were assurances about the safety of staff at its missions following a number of detentions. Turkey said it would relax a visa ban of its own. ",Pence voices U.S. concern to Turkish prime minister about arrests

You look at S&P earnings next year projected to be about $145, you get a tax cut it would probably be (a little above $150). If we don’t have that, earnings are going to be tempered some.

If it is a market that has been based on tax cuts, or a good chunk of the rally has been, you would expect it to pullback if there is a potential breakup in the talks or a delay. It looks like this last leg was based on a delay of potentially a year on the Senate side. So totally expected you would see that. But I would also expect it to rip right back if all of a sudden they come out and say they are making progress.  “Other than that there is really nothing fundamentally changed. Nothing new today, economic numbers - nothing was really out of line. It is certainly tax driven. If there is a decent headline that comes out by the end of the day we will rally right back. Maybe people are not nervous, they shouldn’t be, but I hope there is no complacency in the market, I am always worried about that.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump pressed China to do more to rein in North Korea on Thursday and said bilateral trade had been unfair to the United States, but praised President Xi Jinping’s pledge that China would be more open to foreign firms. On North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs, Trump said “China can fix this problem quickly and easily”, urging Beijing to cut financial links with North Korea and also calling on Russia to help. Trump was speaking alongside Xi in the Chinese capital to announce the signing of about $250 billion in commercial deals between U.S. and Chinese firms, a display that some in the U.S. business community worry detracts from tackling deep-seated complaints about market access in China. Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led initiative. Trump made clear that he blamed his predecessors, not China, for the trade imbalance, and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him “a very special man”. “But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us,” Trump said. Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit and also when Trump said Xi gets things done. “Of course there are some frictions, but on the basis of win-win cooperation and fair competition, we hope we can solve all these issues in a frank and consultative way,” Xi said. “Keeping opening up is our long-term strategy. We will never narrow or close our doors. We will further widen them,” he said. China would also offer a more fair and transparent environment for foreign firms, including U.S. ones, Xi said. Trump is pressing China to tighten the screws further on North Korea and its development of nuclear weapons in defiance of U.N. sanctions. At least modest progress is hoped for, although there are no immediate signs of a major breakthrough, a U.S. official said earlier. Referring to Xi, Trump said: “I do believe there’s a solution to that, as do you.” Xi reiterated that China would strive for the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula but offered no hint that China would change tack on North Korea, with which it fought side-by-side in the 1950-53 Korean war against U.S.-led forces. “We are devoted to reaching a resolution to the Korean peninsula issue through dialogue and consultations,” Xi said. Briefing reporters after the talks, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump told Xi: “You’re a strong man, I’m sure you can solve this for me.” Tillerson said both leaders agreed they could not accept a nuclear-armed North Korea but he acknowledged they had some differences over tactics and timing. Tillerson pointed out that Trump, in a speech in Seoul, had “invited the North Koreans to come to the table,” in line with the Chinese desire for a negotiated solution. He added, however, that Trump was prepared for a “military response” if he deemed the threat serious enough, but “that’s not his first choice”. “We are going to work hard on diplomatic efforts as well,” he said, but did not elaborate. In a show of the importance China puts on Trump’s first official visit, Thursday’s welcoming ceremony outside Beijing’s Great Hall of the People overlooking Tiananmen Square was broadcast live on state television - unprecedented treatment for a visiting leader. Earlier on Thursday, Xi said he had a deep exchange of views with Trump and reached consensus on numerous issues of mutual concern. “For China, cooperation is the only real choice, only win-win can lead to an even better future,” he said. Xi said China and the United States strengthened high-level dialogue on all fronts over the past year and boosted coordination on major international issues, such as the Korean peninsula and Afghanistan. “Relations between China and the United States are now on a new historical starting point,” Xi said. Trump and Xi hit it off at their first meeting in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and continued their “bromance” on Wednesday with an afternoon of sightseeing together with their wives. However, divisions persist over trade and North Korea. And while Xi is riding high after consolidating power at a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress last month, Trump comes to China saddled with low public approval ratings and dogged by investigations into Russian links to his election campaign. Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of China’s massive trade surplus with the United States - calling it “embarrassing” and “horrible” last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices. For its part, China says U.S. restrictions on Chinese investment in the United States and on high-tech exports need to be addressed. Several corporate chief executives were in Beijing as part of a delegation led by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, with General Electric and semiconductor maker Qualcomm Inc among those announcing billions of dollars in sales to China. [L3N1NF2IA] But Qualcomm’s agreement to sell $12 billion worth of components to three Chinese mobile phone makers over three years is non-binding, and critics say such public announcements are sometimes more show than substance. “This shows that we have a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship, and yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China,” said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Trump railed against China’s trade practices during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign and threatened to take action once in office. But he has since held back on any major trade penalties, making clear he was doing so to give Beijing time to make progress reining in North Korea. A U.S. official said both sides were “in sync” about wanting to minimize friction during the visit and recreate the positive tone of the April summit. Trump was not expected to put much emphasis in his talks with Xi on thorny issues such as the disputed South China Sea and self-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its own, although the leaders’ aides may deal with those matters privately, the official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity. China has repeatedly pushed back at suggestions it should be doing more to rein in North Korea, which does about 90 percent of its trade with China, saying it is fully enforcing U.N. sanctions and that everyone has a responsibility to lower tension and get talks back on track.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of 37 U.S.-based scientists whose research focuses on Arctic wildlife asked two U.S. senators in a letter on Thursday not to open the National Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas exploration, according to a copy seen by Reuters. The scientists, including several retired former officials from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service, said in a letter to Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington that drilling for oil and gas in the refuge would be “incompatible with the purposes for which the refuge was established,” protecting fish and wildlife populations and the environments in which they live.   Murkowski, a Republican, introduced legislation on Wednesday that would create an oil and gas exploration program on the refuge’s coastal plain, letting prospectors build any roads and other infrastructure they deemed necessary inside the refuge to carry out their operations. Half of the available drilling royalties would go to the state of Alaska and half to the federal government. The program’s administrator would be required to hold at least two lease sales within 10 years after the bill became law.  The scientists said drilling on the coastal plain would be particularly harmful because it contains a “unique compression” of habitats supporting animals like polar bears, grizzly bears, wolverines, representing “the greatest wildlife diversity of any protected area above the Arctic Circle.” In a Reuters interview, Cantwell praised the scientists for spelling out why drilling would be so harmful to the refuge and she would work to oppose the legislation.  “To try to legislate mandated drilling in a wildlife refuge is just not where America is,” she said.  Murkowski’s spokeswoman declined to comment and referred a comment request to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.  The conflict over whether to allow drilling inside the refuge has deep roots. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates the area on the Prudhoe Bay in Northern Alaska has up to 12 billion barrels of recoverable crude, and Republicans, who now control Congress and the White House, have long wanted to open a portion of the refuge called the 1002 area.  Murkowski, who chairs the Senate Energy Committee, called the 1002 portion a “non wilderness area” because the government put it aside decades ago for petroleum exploration. Last month, Democrats tried and failed to pass legislation blocking drilling there. ",Scientists decry Arctic oil expansion in letter to U.S. senators

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House officials tried to pressure Acting Homeland Security Secretary Elaine Duke into expelling tens of thousands of Honduran immigrants, the Washington Post reported on Thursday,  saying also that Duke said she planned to resign. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert both called Duke about her decision to extend residency permits to the immigrants, the newspaper reported, citing current and former administration officials. The calls came on Monday just as she was about to announce the Temporary Protected Status for the Hondurans, they said. She refused to reverse the decision on the immigrants.  Homeland Security had a Monday deadline to announce plans for 57,000 Hondurans and 2,500 Nicaraguans who were granted TPS after Hurricane Mitch hit Central America in 1998.  Duke ended the protected status for the Nicaraguans on Monday but said DHS needed more time to decide on the Hondurans. She extended their status to July 5, 2018. The officials said Duke was irritated by what she saw as  politically driven interference by White House officials, including her old boss Kelly, who had been Homeland Security secretary. Duke informed Kelly she would resign, the officials said on condition of anonymity.  DHS spokesman Tyler Q. Houlton said in an email that Duke “is committed to continuing her work at DHS” and had made her decision based on current immigration law.  “As with many issues, there were a variety of views inside the administration on TPS,” Houlton said. “It is perfectly normal for members of the White House team to weigh in on major decisions.”  The White House did not respond to requests for comment on reports on the internal debate in the Post and the Wall Street Journal. The Trump administration has targeted the program, which critics say allows participants to repeatedly extend their stays in six-to-18-month increments in case of a natural disaster, civil strife or other emergencies in their homelands.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Whether they like President Donald Trump or not, the U.S. veterans who gather at Hoa’s Place in Danang show little concern that he avoided the war that marked their lives. Trump flies into the Vietnamese resort of Danang on Friday for a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders, landing in a city that for many Americans of his generation was their first sight of Vietnam - and of war. “He’ll finally be able to put on his resume that he was in Vietnam,” said David Clark, 68, who is originally from Akron, Ohio and calls Trump “a joke”. After serving in Vietnam from 1968 to 1969 with the Marine Corps, he has now returned to help with projects to address the legacy of the war. Trump never served in the military. He received five deferments during the Vietnam War, including one for bone spurs in his heel, the New York Times reported last year. The paper quoted Trump as saying the bones spurs had been “temporary”.     “Everyone I know tried to avoid it,” said draftee Keith Soukkala, sipping a beer at Hoa’s Place, a favored bar of veterans near Danang’s “China Beach”. “I stayed out as long as I could but I didn’t have any bone spurs,” said Soukkala, who splits his time between Vietnam and Alaska and said he voted for Trump. At 73, he is two years older than Trump and recalls landing in Danang to the humid heat and “a certain smell in the air” at the start of a 13-month tour with the Marine Corps dodging bombs hidden by the communist Viet Cong guerrillas. The seaside resort of Danang has a special place in U.S.-Vietnamese history: it was here that the first U.S. ground troops disembarked in 1965 in the escalation of a war that would last another decade before the communist victory. Close to some of the heaviest fighting in central Vietnam, Danang had a big U.S. air base. China Beach was a relaxation spot for U.S. soldiers back from combat. Now, Danang’s beachfront hotels draw tourists from around the world. Gleaming office towers mark it out as one of Vietnam’s most modern cities and one the communist government sought to showcase with the hosting of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit which Trump will attend. It’s also home to a community of U.S. veterans who returned to a country where a recent Pew Research survey showed the United States was viewed favorably by 84 percent of people. Clark came back in 2013 for a year and is still in Danang, busy with projects to destroy unexploded U.S. bombs and help families affected by the Agent Orange defoliant linked to illness and deformity. Mark O’Connor, 67, of Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and once part of a helicopter assault team, visits as often as he can to provide bicycles to children in hill villages.      On this visit, though, he said he had come back in the hope of seeing Trump - his support unaffected by the fact the president had not served in Vietnam. “You know, more power to him,” he said. “You can’t feel bad about him and not feel bad about everyone who went to Canada to avoid the draft.” ",Trump's stop in Vietnam a poignant one for U.S. veterans
0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump can return to the United States claiming to have snagged over $250 billion in deals from his maiden trip to Beijing. Whether those deals live up to the lofty price tag is another question altogether. Watched by Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping at a signing ceremony in Beijing, U.S. planemaker Boeing Co, General Electric Co and chip giant Qualcomm Inc sealed lucrative multi-billion dollar deals. “This is truly a miracle,” China’s Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said at a briefing in Beijing. The quarter of a trillion dollar haul underscores how Trump is keen to be seen to address a trade deficit with the world’s second-largest economy that he has long railed against and called “shockingly high” on Thursday. But U.S. businesses still have many long-standing concerns to complain about, including unfettered access to the China market, cybersecurity and the growing presence of China’s ruling Communist Party inside foreign firms. William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China, said the deals pointed to “a strong, vibrant bilateral economic relationship” between the two countries. “Yet we still need to focus on leveling the playing field, because U.S. companies continue to be disadvantaged doing business in China.” U.S. tech companies like Facebook Inc and Google are mostly blocked in China. Automakers Ford Motor Co and General Motors must operate through joint ventures, while Hollywood movies face a strict quota system. “(These deals) allow Trump to portray himself as a master dealmaker, while distracting from a lack of progress on structural reforms to the bilateral trade relationship,” Hugo Brennan, Asia analyst at risk consultancy Verisk Maplecroft, said in a note. Some huge deals were announced. Among them is a 20-year $83.7 billion investment by China Energy Investment Corp in shale gas developments and chemical manufacturing projects in West Virginia, a major energy producing state that voted heavily for Trump in the 2016 election. [ “The massive size of this energy undertaking and level of collaboration between our two countries is unprecedented,” West Virginia Secretary of Commerce H. Wood Thrasher said in a statement. It marks the first major overseas investment for the newly founded China Energy, which formed from the merger of China Shenhua Group, the country’s largest coal producer and China Guodian Corp, one of China’s top five utilities. However, as is often the case during state visits, many of the deals were packaged as “non-binding” agreements, gave scant details or rolled over existing tie-ups, helping pump up the headline figure. “I am somewhat skeptical of such a large number,” Alex Wolf, senior emerging markets economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum, adding that the overall tone of the visit so far had been “positive”. “I suspect they might be primarily MOUs (memorandum of understandings) instead of actual contracts and the actual contract amount may be substantially less.” Qualcomm signed non-binding agreements worth $12 billion with Xiaomi, OPPO and Vivo, three Chinese handset makers that the firm said it had “longstanding relationships” with. Qualcomm already earns more than half of its revenues in China. Boeing announced a deal with state-run China Aviation Suppliers Holding Co to sell 300 Boeing jets with a valuation of $37 billion at list prices, though analysts said it was unclear how many of these were new orders.  “Interesting to see how many of those are past agreements/purchase orders repackaged. Beijing is a master of selling the same agreement 10 times,” former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo posted on Twitter. Speaking alongside Trump in Beijing as they announced the deals, Xi said the Chinese economy would become increasingly open and transparent to foreign firms, including those from the United States, and welcomed U.S. companies to participate in his ambitious “Belt and Road” infrastructure-led initiative. Trump made clear he blamed his predecessors, not China, for allowing the U.s. trade deficit to get “out of kilter”, and repeatedly praised Xi, calling him “a very special man”. “But we will make it fair and it will be tremendous for both of us,” Trump said.  Xi smiled widely when Trump said he does not blame China for the deficit. Asked whether the big package of deals would go some way towards helping fix American trade concerns in China, executives were cautiously optimistic. “Generally the sense was that this is all a good thing, and that’s great,” said Gentry Sayad, a Shanghai-based lawyer who attended the trade delegation event in Beijing.  “Now let’s see what really happens and whether or not the agreements signed during this trip can become a basis for a better bilateral trade relationship going forward.”  ",Trump's $250 billion China 'miracle' adds gloss to 'off-kilter' trade

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Taiwan is the most important and sensitive issue in Sino-U.S. ties, Chinese President Xi Jinping told visiting U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, ahead of the one-year anniversary of Trump taking a precedent-breaking call from Taiwan’s president. China considers democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and integral part of its territory, ineligible for state-to-state relations, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. The United States has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to help it defend itself and is the island’s main source of arms. Trump upset China last December by taking a telephone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, shortly after he won election, the first call between U.S. and Taiwan leaders since President Jimmy Carter switched diplomatic recognition to China from Taiwan in 1979. While there was no public mention of Taiwan in comments Xi and Trump made in front of reporters, the official Chinese foreign ministry statement about their talks did not mince its words. “The Taiwan issue is the most important, most sensitive core issue in China-U.S. relations, and concerns the political basis of the China-U.S. relationship,” the ministry paraphrased Xi as telling Trump. China “hopes that the U.S. side continues to scrupulously abide by the ‘one China’ principle, and prevents disturbances to the broader picture of China-U.S. ties”, Xi added. Trump told Xi that the United States government upheld and stuck to the “one China” policy, China’s official Xinhua news agency reported. In Taipei, Chiu Chui-cheng, deputy minister of Taiwan’s China policy-making Mainland Affairs Council, said China should respect Taiwan’s people. “We think China should deeply understand and respect Taiwan people’s opinions on the growth of relations across the Taiwan Strait,” Chiu told reporters. “We are also willing to work with the other side to find a new, positive model in cross-straits ties that would use dialogue to resolve differences, and to create a proper path for harmonious relations.” China suspects Tsai wants to push for the formal independence of Taiwan, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China but will defend Taiwan’s democracy and security.  China has pressured Taiwan since Tsai took office last year, suspending a regular dialogue mechanism and slowly peeling away its few remaining diplomatic allies. China is deeply suspicious of U.S. intentions toward Taiwan, and was upset when the United States recently allowed Tsai to transit through Hawaii and Guam on her way to and from diplomatic allies of Taiwan’s in the Pacific. Defeated Nationalist forces fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists. ","Taiwan the most important issue in Sino-U.S. ties, China's Xi tells Trump"

Trump said shortly before arriving in Beijing he would discuss as a “top priority” stopping the “flood of cheap and deadly” fentanyl “manufactured in China” when he meets Xi. “Every year drug trafficking destroys millions and millions of lives,” Trump said in Beijing, standing next to Xi at the end of formal talks between the two. “Today President Xi and I discussed ways we can enhance coordination to better counter the deadly drug trade and to stop the lethal flow of poisonous drugs into our countries and into our communities,” he added. “A special emphasis will be placed on the new phenomenon - fentanyl - destroying lives by the millions. We’re going to be focusing on it very strongly, the president and myself,” Trump said, without elaborating. Speaking later to reporters, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Trump and Xi agreed to take new steps. “On the critical issue of opioids, we made some good progress to curb the flow of harmful narcotics into the United States in order to save American lives,” Tillerson said.  “The president committed to taking new actions including agreements to control the export and movement of fentanyl precursors, sharing intelligence on drug trafficking, and exchanging trafficking information,” he added, referring to Xi. China’s drug control agency last week disputed Trump’s claim that most of the synthetic drug fentanyl at the heart of the U.S. opioid crisis was produced in China. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, a highly addictive synthetic drug 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine. The Centers for Disease Control estimated that 20,000 Americans were killed by fentanyl last year, surpassing common painkillers and heroin for the first time. American law enforcement agencies and drug control experts say most of the fentanyl distributed in the United States, as well as precursor chemicals, originate from China. While Chinese officials dispute these claims, Beijing has taken steps to crack down on the production and export of synthetic drugs, and has placed fentanyl and 22 other related compounds on its list of controlled substances.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - If Chinese President Xi Jinping was trying to impress U.S. President Donald Trump with lavish treatment during his visit to Beijing, it appears to have worked. Trump was effusive in his praise of Xi and China, even speaking admiringly of Beijing’s ability to run up a huge trade surplus at U.S. expense, which Trump blamed on his predecessors. He described as “tremendous” his meetings with Xi on topics including trade, North Korea and controlling opioids, despite the lack of major breakthroughs on easing access to China for U.S. companies or further pressuring North Korea to halt its pursuit of nuclear weapons. “My feeling toward you is an incredibly warm one,” Trump said, standing beside Xi. The two had spent the previous afternoon and evening with their wives, touring the Forbidden City and dining there, a privilege rarely extended to visiting leaders. “As we said, there’s great chemistry, and I think we’re going to do tremendous things, both for China and the United States,” Trump said. That chemistry took shape in April, when the two first met at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort, softening the edges on sharp differences over trade and North Korea, and concern in the West over an increasingly prosperous China’s growing assertiveness. While Trump enjoys a chummy, golfing-buddy relationship with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, he has shown admiration for autocratic leaders such as Xi, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Stylistically, the leaders of the world’s two largest economies are opposites: Xi is scripted and cautious, cultivating a down-to-earth image; Trump, a developer and reality TV star before his upset election win a year ago, is known for his off-the-cuff style, freewheeling tweets, and rhetorical hyperbole, both negative and positive. The two also face different political realities at home: Xi has never been more powerful, solidifying his grip at a twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress last month; Trump is saddled with low public approval ratings and dogged by investigations into Russian links to his election campaign, though he and his aides claim credit for the U.S. stock market’s record highs. But Trump appears to recognize the clout that China - and by extension, Xi - wields as a rising power, recently likening Xi to a “king” - and is convinced he needs Beijing’s leverage with North Korea to deal with his biggest global security challenge. The transactional currying of favor cuts both ways: China is eager to deflect U.S. pressure to do more on North Korea, and to avoid an escalation in trade tensions that seemed inevitable after Trump, during his presidential campaign, accused China of “raping” the United States with its trade practices. “China attaches great importance to guanxi (personal relationships) and it’s especially important, given you have a top-down approach to leadership in China, to see Xi get on so well with a foreign leader,” said Wang Huiyao, head of the Center for China and Globalization, a think tank. “It’s much easier to tackle structural problems with a good atmosphere,” he said. Some of their more personal exchanges won prominent play in Chinese social media, including the video of Trump’s granddaughter singing to “Grandpa Xi” and “Grandma Peng”. An exchange between the two leaders in the Forbidden City when Xi explained to Trump that China has the longest unbroken cultural history of any current nation was especially popular. “We are called the descendants of dragons,” Xi tells Trump. “That’s great,” Trump replies and laughs. Trump went so far as to call Xi a “very special man” in a joint briefing on Thursday, and seemed so enthusiastic that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was asked if Trump had been too deferential. “I didn’t detect that at all,” Tillerson said. However, the White House yielded to Beijing’s wish that the two leaders not take questions during a joint press statement. Xi did not openly reciprocate Trump’s personal praise, maintaining his usual stern demeanor, although he grinned when Trump said he did not blame China for the trade gap and again when he said Xi was someone who got things done. “I don’t blame China,” Trump said of the trade deficit.  “Who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for benefit of their citizens? I give China great credit.” ",Trump heaps praise on 'very special' Xi in China visit
0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States and China had a frank exchange of views on the disputed South China Sea during a visit to Beijing by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said. China claims almost the entire strategic waterway through which about $3-trillion worth of goods pass every year, building and militarizing artificial islands. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have conflicting claims. The issue is likely to feature prominently at two regional summits starting this week, one in Vietnam and the other in the Philippines, which Trump and several leaders will attend. Chinese President Xi Jinping will attend the Vietnam meeting. “We had a frank exchange here in China on maritime security issues and the South China Sea. The U.S. position remains unchanged,” Tillerson told reporters.  “We insist on upholding freedom of navigation, that claimants be consistent with international law and that claimants should stop construction and militarization of outposts in order to maximize prospects for successful diplomacy,” he added. Both Xi and Trump expressed support for the protection of peace and stability in the South China Sea, China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement following the leaders’ talks.    Both leaders also support the peaceful resolution and management of the dispute via talks and in accordance with “accepted international law”, it added. “Both sides support the protection of freedom of navigation and overflight for all countries, in accordance with international law,” it said.The United States has angered China with freedom of navigation patrols close to Chinese-controlled islands in the South China Sea, which have been continued by the Trump administration. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, in an apparent policy shift, said on Wednesday he planned to ask China to make clear its intentions in the South China Sea, during Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings in Vietnam. Since coming to office 16 months ago, the firebrand leader has been conciliatory to Beijing, despite a ruling by an international arbitration court favoring the Philippines in its territorial dispute with China. In the past, Duterte has repeatedly said he will raise the sea dispute at the proper time and avoided the issue when Manila hosted two regional meetings this year.

0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump went around and over the “Great Firewall” of China in a late-night tweet in Beijing as he thanked his hosts for a rare tour of the Forbidden City and a private dinner at the sprawling, centuries-old palace complex.  Many Western social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are banned in China. A sophisticated system has been built to deny online users within China access to blocked content.  That was not an issue for Trump, known for tweeting to his 42.3 million followers at any hour of the day, on Wednesday, the day he arrived in Beijing. “On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and I, THANK YOU for an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City in Beijing, President Xi and Madame Peng Liyuan. We are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning!” Trump even changed his Twitter banner, uploading a photograph of himself and Melania with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, during a Chinese opera performance at the Forbidden City.  The Twitter banner upload did not go unnoticed by Chinese state media, with state broadcaster CCTV flashing screenshots of the photograph on Thursday. Trump’s visit was also the third-most talked-about topic on Chinese social media platform Weibo over the last 24 hours, trailing only the birthday of a singer in a Chinese boy band and a weekly Asian pop song chart.  Many people wondered how Trump managed to evade China’s tough internet controls.  “I guess he must have done it via wifi on a satellite network,” said a user on Weibo. Many foreigners log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) to access content hosted outside of China. Another option is to sign up for a data-roaming service before leaving one’s home country.  “The president will tweet whatever he wants. That’s his way of communicating directly with the American people. Why not?” a White House official said ahead of Trump’s arrival in Beijing on Wednesday.  When asked whether China considers Trump’s use of Twitter to be in breach of Chinese law, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said there were many means of communication with “the outside world”.  “In China, people have many channels to communicate, it’s just that they communicate in different ways,” Hua said at a regular ministry briefing. “For example, some people use WeChat, some people use Weibo. Some people use Apple phones, some people use Huawei phones.” Trump tweeted again on Thursday afternoon, posting an ABC News video montage of the “incredible” welcome parade at the Great Hall of the People, where he was greeted by a military band and jumping, flag-waving children.  In his tweet, Trump embedded a link to a photograph of his Beijing visit on Instagram - also forbidden in China.  Not all of Trump’s tweets in China were bright and cheerful.  “NoKo has interpreted America’s past restraint as weakness,” he tweeted about reclusive North Korea’s nuclear and missile threats. “This would be a fatal miscalculation.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Democrats claimed historic gains in Virginia’s statehouse and booted Republicans from state and local office across the United States on Tuesday, in the party’s first big wave of victories since Republican Donald Trump’s won the White House a year ago. Democrats must figure out how to turn that momentum to their  advantage in November 2018 elections, when control of the U.S. Congress and scores of statehouses will be at stake. From coast to coast, Democratic victories showed grassroots resistance to Trump rallying the party’s base, while independent and conservative voters appeared frustrated with the unpopular Republican leadership in Washington.  Democrats won this year’s races for governor in Virginia and New Jersey, but successes in legislative and local races nationwide may have revealed more about where the party stands a year into Trump’s administration. Unexpectedly massive Democratic gains in Virginia’s statehouse surprised even the most optimistic party loyalists in a state that has trended Democratic in recent years but remains a top target for both parties in national elections.  “This is beyond our wildest expectations, to be honest,” said Catherine Vaughan, co-founder of Flippable, one of several new startup progressive groups rebuilding the party at the grassroots level. With several races still too close to call, Democrats were close to flipping, or splitting, control of the Virginia House of Delegates, erasing overnight a two-to-one Republican majority. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Ralph Northam also defeated Republican Ed Gillespie by nearly nine percentage points in what had seemed a closer contest for Virginia’s governor’s mansion, a year after Democrat Hillary Clinton carried the state by five points in the presidential election. The losing candidate had employed Trump-style campaign tactics that highlighted divisive issues such as immigration, although the president did not join him on the campaign trail. In New Jersey, a Democratic presidential stronghold, voters replaced a two-term Republican governor with a Democrat and increased the party’s majorities in the state legislature. Democrats notched additional wins in a Washington state Senate race that gave the party full control of the state government and in Republican-controlled Georgia, where Democrats picked up three seats in special state legislative elections. “This was the first chance that the voters got to send a message to Donald Trump and they took advantage of it,” John Feehery, a Republican strategist in Washington, said by phone. The gains suggested to some election analysts that Democrats could retake the U.S. House of Representatives next year. Republicans control both the House and Senate along with the White House. Dave Wasserman, who analyzes U.S. House and statehouse races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, called the Virginia results a “tidal wave.” Even after Tuesday’s gains, however, Democrats are completely locked out of power in 26 state governments. Republicans control two-thirds of U.S. legislative chambers. Desperate to rebuild, national Democrats this year showed newfound interest in legislative contests and races even farther down the ballot. The Democratic National Committee successfully invested in mayoral races from St. Petersburg, Florida, to Manchester, New Hampshire. “If there is a lesson to be taken from yesterday, it is that we need to make sure that we are competing everywhere, because Democrats can win,” DNC Chairman Tom Perez said on a media call. Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee executive director Jessica Post said national party leaders must remain focused on local races, even in a congressional year. “We don’t focus enough on the state level, and that is why we are in the place we are,” she said. “But when we do, we win.” ",Democrats ride grassroots wave to major statehouse gains
0,True,"November 9, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A top Chinese coal miner, Yankuang Group, and U.S. industrial gas supplier Air Products and Chemicals Inc on Thursday said they planned to build a $3.5 billion coal-to-synthesis gas (syngas) plant in China.  The announcement on the facility in the province of Shaanxi comes as part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s state visit to China, the world’s biggest consumer of coal. The deal is yet to be finalised, although the companies said in a statement that they would look to do this as soon as possible. Syngas is a combination of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and some carbon dioxide that is typically manufactured by gasifying a solid hydrocarbon fuel. It can be used to create energy or to help churn out products such as methane or methanol. Under the agreement, Air Products and Shaanxi Future Energy Group Co (SFEC), a subsidiary of Yankuang, will form a joint venture, in which Air Products will have a majority stake. It will build, own and operate an air separation, gasification and syngas clean-up system in the city of Yulin to supply SFEC, the firms said in a statement.  The air separation units are expected to produce about 40,000 tonnes per day (TPD) of oxygen to support the production of about 2.5 million normal cubic meters an hour of syngas.  SFEC will supply coal, steam and power and receive syngas under a long-term, onsite contract. Air Products currently supplies SFEC’s Phase 1 project in Yulin with 12,000 TPD of oxygen.  The addition of Phase 2 would make the complex one of the largest coal-to-fuel and chemicals facilities in China, with SFEC Phase 2 producing 4 million tonnes per year of liquid fuels and downstream chemicals, it said. The companies expect the overall project to come onstream in 2021. ","U.S. firm Air Products, China's Yankuang plan to build $3.5 billion coal-to-syngas plant in China"

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. foreign service has seen its top ranks shrink under Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, according to a letter written by the head of the union representing U.S. diplomats and seen by Reuters on Wednesday. The number of career ambassadors, the foreign service’s highest personal rank granted to only a handful of U.S. diplomats, has dropped by 60 percent, according to the letter by American Foreign Service Association (AFSA) President Barbara Stephenson. The number of career ambassadors declined to two from five with this year’s retirement of William Brownfield, Kristie Kenney and Victoria Nuland, who held top State Department jobs. The next rung down, with the rank of “career minister,’ has shrunk to 19 from 33, the letter said, and the one beneath, of “minister-counselor,” has dropped to 369 from 431 in early September and continues to decline. “These numbers are hard to square with the stated agenda of making State and the Foreign Service stronger. Were the U.S. military to face such a decapitation of its leadership ranks, I would expect a public outcry,” Stephenson said in the letter to members of the union. Since taking office on Feb. 1, Tillerson has embraced the White House’s proposal - rejected by key members of Congress - to cut the State Department budget by about 30 percent and imposed a hiring freeze while analyzing the agency’s operations and deciding how to reorganize them. The State Department did not dispute the numbers cited in the letter, but an agency spokesman who declined to be identified said that “suggestions that drastic cuts to our foreign service ranks are taking place are simply not accurate.” The spokesman said the 60 percent reduction in the number of career ambassadors was misleading because there were only five at the start of the year and that Tillerson “plans to nominate individuals for this role in the near future.” The spokesman did not provide apples-to-apples comparisons on the number of diplomats with the rank of career minister and minister-counselor, but did give figures for a broader set of senior U.S. diplomats. “As of October 31, 2017, the Senior Foreign Service is comprised of 976 diplomats, with 63 waiting for Congress to attest their promotion into the senior ranks,” he said. “Once these promotions are attested, there will be 1,039 Senior Foreign Service Officers, a number nearly identical to the 1,058 Senior Foreign Service Officers at the same point in 2016.” According to Stephenson’s letter, the U.S. diplomatic corps is also shrinking at the bottom rung. The letter said “intake into the Foreign Service at State will drop from 366 in 2016 to around 100 new entry-level officers joining ... in 2018.” The number of people applying to take the competitive exam to enter the U.S. Foreign Service is projected to be cut by more than half this year from over 17,000 people in 2015, she said. An AFSA spokesman said that figure was for calendar 2015. The State Department spokesman said 9,519 took the exam in fiscal 2017, which ended on Sept. 30, down from 11,886 in fiscal 2016 and 14,480 in fiscal 2015. “This trend corresponds with an improving economy and similar trends have been observed in the past,” he said. In her letter, Stephenson noted congressional support for State Department funding and argued that Tillerson was weakening the U.S. foreign service. “Given this clear congressional intent, we have to ask: Why such a focus on slashing staffing at State? Why such a focus on decapitating leadership? How do these actions serve the stated agenda of making the State Department stronger?” she wrote. “Where then, does the impetus come from to weaken the American Foreign Service?  Where is the mandate to pull the Foreign Service team from the field and forfeit the game to our adversaries?” she added. While not directly addressing those questions, the State Department spokesman said: “The goal of the redesign has always been to find new ways to best leverage our team’s brains, ingenuity, and commitment to serving our nation’s interests.” ",Top ranks of career U.S. diplomats thin under Tillerson: union

Trump last week tapped Powell, 64, a Fed governor since 2012, to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second four-year term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. Powell is quickly garnering support from Republican lawmakers, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who met with Powell on Tuesday and said he looked forward to “supporting his nomination.” Republican Senator Mike Crapo, who chairs the Banking Committee, said on Wednesday that Powell was “well-equipped to lead our economy and the country in a positive direction.” Powell is widely expected to continue to raise interest rates gradually, as Yellen began to do in late 2015, and to shrink the central bank’s $4.5 trillion balance sheet.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate tax-cut bill, differing from one in the House of Representatives, was expected to be unveiled on Thursday, complicating a Republican tax overhaul push and increasing skepticism on Wall Street about the effort. As the House tax committee worked on its bill, members of the Senate weighed new approaches to corporate taxes, deductions for state and local taxes and the estate tax on inherited assets, senators said, providing few details. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters that senators would be briefed on the bill on Thursday before its release.  House and Senate Republicans are working on separate plans for the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code since the 1980s. President Donald Trump and his House allies have proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, one of the costliest features of the wide-ranging House plan. The tax overhaul is a priority for Trump, who says it will boost economic growth and create jobs. Republicans have yet to score a major legislative win since he took office in January, although they control Congress as well as the White House. Democrats have blasted the proposals in the Republican tax legislation as giveaways to large corporations and the rich. Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax-writing finance committee, told reporters he would prefer not to delay a corporate tax cut by a year, which some lawmakers said was a possibility. “I’d prefer to get it done,” he said. Financial markets have rallied since Trump’s stunning election victory in November 2016, partly on expectations that he and Congress would slash taxes on businesses. Stock markets closed little changed on Wednesday, with investors focused on chances for a tax bill becoming law. “I do think there’s disappointment with Republicans kicking the tax bill around. ... Some of the things leaking out are not encouraging,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The latest version of the House bill would add $1.7 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which tallies the costs of legislation. That would violate a rule requiring the legislation to add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit. But Representative Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House tax committee, said he would revise the legislation on Thursday to bring it into compliance.  A report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank said the biggest tax cuts would go to high-income households under the current bill, which would raise taxes on more than one in four taxpayers by 2027 because of the expiration of certain benefits including a $300 family credit,  Top earners with incomes of more than $730,000 would get 21 percent of the benefits in 2018 and nearly 50 percent in a decade, the report said. The House bill would repeal a tax deduction Americans can now take for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for business owners. It would cap the deduction for state and local property tax paid at $10,000.  Republican Senator David Perdue told reporters the Senate bill could repeal the entire state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a concern for people in heavily Democratic high-tax states such as California, New York and New Jersey.    Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said victories for Democrats in state elections on Tuesday should be a warning to Republicans. “The Republicans should look at the elections last night, and it should be a giant stop sign for their tax bill,” Schumer said. There are enough Republicans from high-tax states in the House to torpedo the tax bill, given that Democrats broadly oppose it. Republicans, who have a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, also may need support from Democrats to pass their version. The House and Senate must agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president. Republican Senator Susan Collins, whose vote is crucial, declined to say if the Senate bill would duplicate the House’s proposed estate tax repeal. But she told reporters: “It’s certainly true that I expressed reservations about having complete repeal.”   A Washington tax expert raised concern about a House provision to create a 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, saying it would do little to help small business and be vulnerable to abuse. Pass-through businesses, which include mom-and-pop enterprises and large private companies, are not organized as publicly traded corporations. Profits are passed through to their owners as individual income and taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said the new pass-through rate “would add great complexity” and “provide plenty of opportunity for clever investors and business owners ... to game the system.” In addition, a proposed 20 percent excise tax meant to discourage foreign companies from shifting U.S. profits offshore “appears dead,” said Chris Krueger, an analyst at financial firm Cowen’s Washington Research Group. The tax was amended by the House committee after complaints from multinational companies. “Now, the one real safeguard in the plan ... is all but gone,” said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the FACT Coalition, a liberal tax activist group in Washington.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The U.S. government made it tougher on Wednesday for Americans to visit Cuba and do business in the country, making good on a pledge by President Donald Trump to roll back his Democratic predecessor’s move toward warmer ties with Havana. The restrictions, which take effect on Thursday, are aimed at preventing the military, intelligence and security arms of Cuba’s Communist government from benefiting from American tourists and trade, the White House said. They fill in the regulatory detail on a Trump policy speech in June, in which the Republican president called for a tightening of restrictions. He said then that the Cuban government continued to oppress its people and former President Barack Obama had made too many concessions in his 2014 diplomatic breakthrough with Washington’s former Cold War foe. The regulations include a ban on Americans doing business with some 180 Cuban government entities, holding companies, and tourism companies. The list includes 83 state-owned hotels, including famous hotels in Old Havana such as Ernest Hemingway’s erstwhile favorite haunt the Hotel Ambos Mundos, as well as the city’s new luxury shopping mall. “All these measures hurt the Cuban people,” said Cuba’s Foreign Ministry chief for U.S. Affairs Josefina Vidal. She said that government revenue funds Cuba’s free education and healthcare systems. Speaking to reporters in Havana, she called the list “arbitrary” and the regulations a further “setback” in U.S.-Cuban relations. The new rules were criticized as too lax by Republican leaders who favor a hard line, but as counterproductive by those who agreed with Obama’s rationale for the detente: that Washington’s many decades of isolating the Caribbean island failed to force change. The Cuban hotels listed included those run by military-linked chains Gaviota and Habaguanex. Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American, said the list failed to go far enough because it omitted companies like Gran Caribe Hotel Group and Cubanacan that have ties to the Cuban government. Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy said the regulations were unfair to Cuba, coming as Trump was being “feted in Beijing” by a Communist government “in a country to which Americans can travel freely.” “The hypocrisy of the White House ideologues is glaring,” Leahy said in a statement.  While U.S. travelers will still be able to make authorized trips to Cuba with a U.S.-based organization and accompanied by a U.S. representative of the group, it will be harder for them to travel individually, according to the new regulations. Before Obama’s opening, travel by many Americans was similarly restricted to such organized trips. Travelers need to be able to show a “full-time schedule” with activities that support Cuban people and show “meaningful interaction,” going beyond merely staying in rooms in private homes, eating in private restaurants, or shopping in private stores, a U.S. official told reporters on a conference call. The administration says it is keen to support such small private enterprises that have sprung up around the country under President Raul Castro’s reforms to the largely state-controlled economy. “Staying or eating or shopping in some of those privately owned places is something that we wanted to encourage. But what we wanted to say is, that alone is not enough,” the official said. However, Cubans in the fledgling private sector say the Trump administration’s more hostile stance toward Havana has already hurt their business. “He is putting us in serious danger by frightening away American visitors looking to rent our properties,” said Norma Hernandez, who rents out rooms on Airbnb and who said her  business flourished over the last year thanks to a surge in U.S. visitors. Trump’s rollback of Obama’s opening has not affected a  centerpiece of the detente, the restoration of diplomatic ties and the opening of embassies in Havana and Washington. Business contracts and travel arrangements already in place will be allowed to go ahead and will not be subject to the restrictions, officials told reporters. The list of entities that Americans cannot do business with includes a special development zone at Cuba’s Mariel port, which Cuba hopes to develop into a major Caribbean industrial and shipping hub with tax and customs breaks. The National Foreign Trade Council, a business lobby group in Washington, called the Mariel restriction “counterproductive” because it would hurt a Cuban government initiative that could potentially benefit Cuban workers. The head of an educational travel company said there were still many legal avenues - as well as commercial flights, cruise ships, U.S.-owned hotels, and tour providers - to enable Americans to visit Cuba.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic election victories in Virginia and New Jersey showed Republicans losing more ground in suburban areas, where President Donald Trump’s unpopularity could cost them dearly in next year’s congressional races.  The results from Tuesday, particularly in Virginia, suggest that Trump’s strategy of playing to a loyal but limited base has not enabled him to broaden support for his presidency or his party. Democrats were delighted, believing that control of the U.S. House of Representatives, and perhaps even the Senate, now both controlled by Republicans, might be up for grabs in next year’s elections. Some Republicans shared that view after their party’s candidates did poorly among independent, college-educated, women, and minority voters in suburban areas. “Unless we get our act together, we are going to lose heavily,” Republican Senator John McCain said on Wednesday.  Democrats would need to pick up 24 seats next year to retake control of the House. Should that happen, Trump’s policy agenda would be effectively dead and the administration would come under greater scrutiny.  The win by Democrat Phil Murphy in New Jersey’s governor’s race came as no surprise because of the unpopularity of outgoing Republican Governor Chris Christie. But Ralph Northam’s 9-point victory over Republican Ed Gillespie for governor in swing-state Virginia was larger than expected. Trump quickly tried to distance himself from Gillespie’s poor showing, saying on Twitter that the Republican candidate “worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for.” Still, Trump’s leadership record appeared to motivate Democrats to vote in record numbers in Virginia, with exit polls showing that many came out simply to express their displeasure with the president.  “Trump is turning off more voters than he’s bringing in,” said Rodell Mollineau, a Democratic strategist in Washington. “His base is strong, but it isn’t growing.” During his first year in office, Trump has consistently played to a base of passionate supporters, many of them older white men who live in rural areas declining in population, and has shown little inclination to reach out to the majority of voters who disapprove of him.  Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster based in Virginia, said the party was on a risky track. “Republicans have traded fast-growing upscale suburban counties for slow-growing or declining rural areas. That is not a formula for long-term success.” There also may be signs of slippage in Trump’s political  base.  In Virginia, Gillespie campaigned hard on immigration and crime - two hot issues with the president’s supporters - but did worse than expected in some rural and suburban areas that Trump easily won last year. In rural Dickenson County, considered to be the heart of Trump country in Virginia, Gillespie’s margin over Northam was almost 7 percentage points less than Trump’s margin of victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton last year.  Trump won the city of Virginia Beach in 2016 by 3 points, but Gillespie lost to Northam there by 5, a swing of eight points. More critically, Gillespie was blown out by Northam in northern Virginia’s populous suburbs, where Trump also struggled in the presidential race. “The suburbs came out in full force,” said Matt Mackowiak, a Republican strategist. “They appear to be very motivated to try and deliver a message to Trump.” In growing Loudoun County, outside of Washington, Democrat Barack Obama barely edged out Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. On Tuesday, Northam buried Gillespie there by almost 20 points. “I’m worried,” Ari Fleischer, a former White House spokesman for Republican President George W. Bush, told Fox News on Wednesday. “Democrats came out in huge numbers yesterday in the races and if they have that kind of enthusiasm going into 2018, it’s going to be very tough sailing for Republicans.” Gillespie, a longtime Washington insider and lobbyist, tried to keep his distance from Trump personally even as he adopted some of his more combative campaign rhetoric. It was a strategy that failed and Mackowiak said the result reflected Trump’s historically low approval rating. “I don’t think the White House was worried about that before, but now I think they have to be.” The five-day Reuters/Ipsos tracking poll has Trump hovering around 35 percent approval nationally, with close to 60 percent of respondents disapproving of his performance in office. A person familiar with Trump’s political operation dismissed the election results on Tuesday as having anything to do with the president, noting that both New Jersey and Virginia were won by Clinton in 2016. Andrew Surabian, an adviser to the pro-Trump political group Great America Alliance, said Gillespie lost because he was exactly the kind of establishment Republican that Trump voters have rejected. “Ed Gillespie’s campaign went down in flames because he failed to fully embrace the president or his agenda,” Surabian said, “and without a coherent message and an authentic messenger, Republican candidates will not be successful moving forward.” ",Trump's limited appeal a warning sign for Republicans ahead of 2018 elections
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A congressional panel on Wednesday dropped attempts to force the founder of a firm that hired a former British spy to compile a dossier of links between the 2016 Trump election campaign and Russia to testify under oath, a lawyer for the firm said. Fusion GPS lawyer Joshua Levy said in a statement that Republican Representative Mike Conaway and Democrat Adam Schiff, leaders of the U.S. House Intelligence Committee’s investigation of Trump campaign contacts with Russia, had “agreed to withdraw a subpoena” served on Glenn Simpson, a founder of the firm. “Mr. Simpson will instead sit for a voluntary interview next week, and nothing will be said at that interview – per the agreement of Mr. Conaway and Mr. Schiff – shall interfere with Mr. Simpson’s ability to assert privileges in this investigation,” Levy said. Simpson and Levy met with the committee for about three hours on Wednesday, reaching the agreement for Simpson to testify to the panel behind closed doors on Nov. 14, Schiff and Conaway told reporters. Levy said that under the agreement, Fusion GPS would be allowed to “cooperate while honoring its obligations to clients.” Three congressional committees and a special counsel are looking into former MI6 officer Christopher Steele’s reports that are central to investigations into U.S. allegations that Russia tried to help Donald Trump’s campaign. Russia has repeatedly denied the allegations and President Trump has called the probes a witch hunt. Fusion lawyer Levy said that on Aug. 22, Simpson had appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee and answered questions for 10 hours. Two other Fusion investigators also were summoned before the House Intelligence Committee, but they declined to respond to questions, citing their rights under the First and Fifth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which protect free speech and allow legal witnesses to avoid self-incrimination. The committee chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, recused himself from the investigation, but he and some other Republicans have continued seeking information about who paid Fusion for the dossier. The company has resisted such disclosures, saying it promises its clients confidentiality. A conservative website, the Washington Free Beacon, has already said that it hired Fusion to research Trump and other Republican candidates. A law firm representing the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s campaign later paid Fusion $1.02 million for work on Trump and Russia.  A lawsuit by Fusion against its own bank seeking to block a subpoena the House Intelligence Committee issued for two years of the bank’s records is still pending in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., a Fusion representative said.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrats on the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee have been undertaking their own investigation, without Republicans, on what they term “Russia’s malign influence around the world,” a spokesman for the Democratic side of the committee said on Wednesday. Sean Bartlett, a spokesman for Senator Ben Cardin, who has been leading the effort, said the Democrats are preparing a “major report” on how Russia seeks to sow distrust and confusion, promote radical voices on divisive issues and gain leverage, while eroding support for democracy and institutions. The investigation was first reported by The Daily Beast. It comes as a handful of Republican-led congressional committees, including the Senate and House of Representatives Intelligence Committees, as well as Special Counsel Robert Mueller, investigate alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election and whether there was collusion between Republican President Donald Trump’s campaign and Moscow. Trump has denied any collusion. Moscow denies meddling. While the Foreign Relations Democrats are not looking into the U.S. contest, they said they had discovered Russian-led efforts to influence elections in many countries. “The report describes how these efforts are led by the government’s security services and buttressed by state-owned enterprises, Kremlin-aligned oligarchs, and Russian criminal groups that have effectively been nationalized by the state,” Bartlett said in an emailed statement. The committee’s investigations have included contacts with foreign governments. Ukraine, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland are among countries that have discussed Russian meddling. Committee Republicans said they were aware of the investigation, but not involved. “We are aware that Senator Cardin is developing a report on Russian efforts to interfere in European elections, but his staff has not yet shared it with us,” said Micah Johnson, a spokeswoman for Senator Bob Corker, the committee’s Republican chairman. It was not clear when the report might be released publicly. ",Democrats working on independent Russia probe
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is more popular with likely voters than he is with the general public, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that underscores why Republican lawmakers have largely stuck with the polarizing president despite his plunging approval ratings. The poll, released on Wednesday, shows he polls better among people who voted in the 2016 presidential election than with the overall U.S. adult population – a group that includes both voters and non-voters. Only about 60 percent of the voting-age public took part in last year’s election. In October, for example, 44 percent of 2016 voters said they approved of Trump’s performance in office, compared with 37 percent of the general population. Among Republicans, 82 percent of voters approved of Trump in October, compared with 75 percent of all Republicans. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2zoIC1A) Some 85 percent of those who voted for Trump in 2016 said they would do so again, the poll found. The findings suggest that Republican candidates in the 2018 congressional elections who shun the president risk alienating his followers, Republican strategists and political scientists said. At the same time, those who embrace him in the early primary races that choose party candidates risk losing moderate voters in the general election. “It’s very difficult for any Republican candidate to distance themselves from Trump,” said Michael McDonald, an expert on voter turnout at the University of Florida.  That dilemma played out in Virginia on Tuesday, when Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate in the governor’s race, was soundly beaten by his Democratic opponent. Gillespie had adopted some of Trump’s hardline positions but had avoided campaigning with the unpopular president.  Gillespie’s strategy had been closely watched within the party to see if it could provide a template for other Republican candidates in 2018, when control of the House of Representatives and the Senate will be up for grabs. Gillespie’s loss sparked debate among Republicans on the way forward on Wednesday. Trump suggested in a tweet that the outcome could have been different had Gillespie fully embraced him, but critics pointed out that exit polls showed that a third of Virginian voters had turned out to signal displeasure with Trump, double the number who cast ballots to express support for the president.  Tuesday’s results clearly signal that opposition to Trump has grown, even though he remains popular among 2016 Republican voters, said Elaine Kamarck, an expert in presidential politics at the Brookings Institution.  For Republicans, “the hurdle won’t be with getting out the base,” Kamarck said. “It will be in getting anyone else to vote for you” in elections where Republican voters are outnumbered. Reuters/Ipsos was able to compare the opinions of voters with the general public by creating two separate surveys: a poll of voters and a poll of the public.  For the voter poll, Reuters/Ipsos reconnected with people who took its exit poll on Nov. 8, 2016, the day of the U.S. presidential election. Those voters were sent additional questionnaires in May, July and October that asked if they approved or disapproved of the president.  Their responses were then compared with the results of a separate survey – the Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll – that surveys all adults in the United States. In May and July, the results of both polls were nearly identical, with about 40 percent of voters and the general adult population expressing approval for the president. The two polls diverged in October, however, with voters expressing stronger levels of approval than the general public.  Jan Leighley, an expert on political behavior at American University, said it makes sense that Trump is more popular among people who voted in the 2016 election. They were more likely to be white and less likely to identify with Democrats than the general public, she said.  The Reuters/Ipsos poll is conducted online in English throughout the country. Some 1,206 of those 2016 voters took the  survey between May 10-12, followed by 1,296 who took the July 11-12 survey and 1,195 who took the survey between Oct. 18-19.  Individual responses were weighted so they would reflect the latest population estimates, as well as the support their presidential pick received in the election. Each of the voter polls had a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 5 percentage points for Republican voters.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Congressional Budget Office said on Wednesday that repealing the Obamacare individual mandate would increase the number of uninsured by 13 million by 2027 and reduce the federal budget deficit less than initially forecast. The CBO, the nonpartisan budget-scoring agency, said that eliminating the Obamacare mandate that all Americans purchase health insurance or else pay a fine would lower the deficit by $338 billion over the next decade, not $416 billion as it estimated in December. The agency found that health insurance premiums would rise by about 10 percent in most years over the next decade in the individual market created by the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. It noted that markets in most areas of the country would remain stable. President Donald Trump and some Republicans favor including a repeal of the mandate in tax overhaul legislation. But lawmakers, Republican aides and lobbyists have said it would be difficult to include a repeal in a tax effort complicated by intraparty differences and intense business lobbying. The U.S. House of Representatives unveiled its tax plan last week, and the Senate’s plan is expected to be released on Thursday. The individual mandate is a central tenet of Obamacare that health policy experts and proponents say is essential to making the law work. It compels young and healthy people to join health insurance markets and help lower premiums by offsetting the costs of sicker patients. Americans must note on their tax returns whether they have health coverage. Yet it has proved to be among the most controversial portions of the law as Republicans, who say Obamacare is too expensive and an example of government overreach, argue that the federal government should not be able to require people to buy health insurance if they do not want it. The CBO said in its December report that the individual mandate increases the federal deficit by encouraging people to buy subsidized coverage, either through Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled, employer-provided plans, or through the Obamacare individual health insurance market.  Eliminating the mandate would lower the deficit by reducing federal spending on subsidized health insurance coverage, it said. The CBO said abolishing the requirement would cause premiums to rise because healthier people would be less likely to purchase insurance. It found that the resulting increases would cause more people to forego insurance. ","Repeal of individual mandate would increase uninsured, premiums: CBO"

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Maine Governor Paul LePage said on Wednesday he would not carry out an expansion of the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare that was approved by voters unless it was fully funded by the legislature, calling it “ruinous” for the state’s budget. About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot proposal in Tuesday’s election, according to the Bangor Daily News, making the state the first in the country to vote to expand Medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor and disabled. LePage, a Republican, has staunchly opposed expansion of the program, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions. In a statement, the governor said he would not implement the expansion until it was fully funded by the Maine legislature, where control is split between Republicans and Democrats.  “Credit agencies are predicting that this fiscally irresponsible Medicaid expansion will be ruinous to Maine’s budget,” LePage said in a statement. “I will not support increasing taxes on Maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled.” LePage said a previous Medicaid expansion in Maine in 2002 created $750 million in debt to hospitals and took resources away from vulnerable people. Maine Senate Democratic leader Troy Jackson said in a statement that the governor “has the power to put up roadblocks to prevent implementation of the voter-approved Medicaid expansion referendum, and I have no reason to believe he won’t continue to do as he has always done.” Jackson added that Democrats “are determined to use every tool at our disposal to ensure the will of the voters is upheld.”     Maine voters were asked to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under age 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.  If implemented, about 70,000 additional state residents would be eligible for the Medicaid program, local media reported, in addition to the roughly 268,000 people who are currently eligible. Maine has been prominent in the national healthcare debate. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from the state, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal Obamacare, enacted under former Democratic President Barack Obama and formally known as the Affordable Care Act. Collins said on Wednesday she never took a position on state referendum questions, but was surprised at LePage’s statement. “I’m not going to comment on what the governor should or should not do”, Collins told reporters. “I think it’s significant that healthcare was such a prominent issue and I believe when you look at the overwhelming vote in my state (on) the Medicaid expansion that it shows that Republicans need to put forth constructive legislation.”  ",Maine governor says he will not expand Medicaid despite vote
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday advanced legislation to make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, the most concrete action from Congress this year to tighten regulation of internet companies.  The approval came after major U.S. internet companies  dropped their opposition to the measure, which amends a decades-old law that is considered a bedrock legal shield for the companies. In a unanimous voice vote, the Senate Commerce Committee passed a measure that gives states and sex-trafficking victims a means to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms. The bill rewrites Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which generally protects companies from liability for the activities of their users. The changes, which have bipartisan support, will still need to pass the full Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law. “This is a momentous day in our fight to hold online sex traffickers accountable and help give trafficking survivors the justice they deserve,” Republican Senator Rob Portman, who co-authored the bill, known as the Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act, said in a statement. After decades of little oversight from Washington, the internet industry is facing increased scrutiny from lawmakers in both parties over concerns about their size and how their platforms were used by Russia during the 2016 election. More than 40 senators have co-sponsored the bill, and Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, has endorsed it. Internet companies had long objected to proposals in Congress to rewrite Section 230, arguing the measure had allowed innovation in Silicon Valley to thrive. But the Internet Association, an industry group whose members include Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Alphabet’s Google (GOOGL.O), announced support for the Senate bill last week after a series of changes.  Those edits clarified that criminal charges would be based on violations of federal human trafficking law and that a standard for liability would require a website to “knowingly” assist in facilitating trafficking. Democratic Senator Ron Wyden on Wednesday placed a hold on the bill to prevent it from quickly getting a vote in the full Senate, saying it favored big tech companies at the expense of startups and would “stifle innovation.”  In a letter on Tuesday, a dozen civil liberties organizations said the bill would threaten free speech online and unevenly harm smaller companies with fewer resources to police their platforms.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. Senator from Michigan on Wednesday urged his fellow lawmakers to retain a $7,500 tax credit for people who buy electronic vehicles instead of eliminating it as Republicans have proposed. In a letter seen by Reuters, Senator Gary Peters wrote to Senate leaders that “a new generation of jobs and families will be supported by electric vehicles. Eliminating important economic incentives for electric vehicles would be a step in the wrong direction.” Last week, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives proposed to eliminate the tax credit, which could hurt automakers such as General Motors Co (GM.N), Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T). Republicans in both chambers of Congress backed by U.S. President Donald Trump, also a Republican, are working on separate plans to give the U.S. tax code its biggest overhaul since the 1980s. Republican senators are set to introduce a tax proposal on Thursday. A spokesman for Senator Orrin Hatch, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, did not immediately comment. Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies. Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models. Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. GM and Tesla may hit the limit for vehicles that can get the tax credit by 2019. Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group oppose the House proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are “an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles.” Tesla declined to comment. Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate. Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The judge presiding over the criminal case against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager issued a gag order on Wednesday barring anyone involved in the case from making public statements that might taint it.  Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were arraigned in federal court in Washington last week on a 12-count indictment that accused them of conspiring to launder money, failing to disclose foreign bank accounts and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said in her written order she wanted to make sure the trial was fair and that potential jurors were not influenced by pre-trial publicity. She directed the defendants, all lawyers and any potential witnesses to “refrain from making statements to the media or in public settings that pose a substantial likelihood of material prejudice” to the case.  Jackson had previously warned lawyers about discussing the case publicly after Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing made a defiant statement outside the courthouse following his client’s arraignment on Monday. “This is a criminal trial and not a public relations campaign,” Jackson said in court last week. Downing, appearing before television cameras on Monday, said the charges against Manafort were “ridiculous” and said the president was correct to insist there was “no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.” The charges against Manafort and Gates stem from special counsel Robert Mueller’s probe of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. Manafort and Gates have both pleaded not guilty.  The Kremlin has denied meddling in the election and Trump has denied any collusion took place. Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment. Jackson had asked the parties last week if they had any objections to a gag order. None responded. Downing’s statements outside the courthouse had raised eyebrows among defense lawyers. “Judge Jackson is a no-nonsense judge and he’s clearly angered her to no purpose,” said Eric Lewis, a longtime Washington trial lawyer. But Los Angeles defense lawyer Mark Geragos said he thought Downing might indeed have had a purpose in mind: currying favor with Trump in the hopes of eventually securing Manafort a presidential pardon. “The cynic in me would say that was exactly what was happening,” said Geragos, “that there was an audience of one.”  ",U.S. judge issues gag order in Manafort case
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The Minnesota Senate will furlough its workers and suspend operations as soon as Dec. 1 due to an ongoing funding dispute with Governor Mark Dayton, the chamber’s Republican leader announced on Wednesday.   Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka said his chamber will run out of money by next month unless the state courts restore funding for the legislature that was vetoed by Dayton. He added that the Senate plans to seek certain funds from the Legislative Coordinating Committee which would keep the chamber operating through Jan. 12. “We don’t take the suspension of operations of the Minnesota Senate lightly – this is not a game – but we really have no other choice today,” Gazelka said in a statement. The chamber’s workforce includes dozens of lawyers, analysts, researchers and assistants who work with committees and on legislation. The Democratic governor’s office blamed Gazelka for the impending shutdown. “Despite sitting on nearly $45 million in available state funding for his operations, he and other legislative leaders are choosing to lay off their own employees, rather than admit that they have misled the courts, the press, and the public about their true financial situation,” said Matt Swenson, the governor’s assistant chief of staff.   Dayton in May vetoed funding for the Republican-controlled legislature from the state’s new two-year budget in an effort to pressure lawmakers to revise tax measures that he said will harm the state’s financial stability. The move touched off a legal battle with lawmakers, who claimed the elimination of nearly $130 million in funding was unconstitutional. While a Ramsey County District Court judge sided with the legislature in July, the state Supreme Court on Sept. 8 determined that the governor’s action was constitutional. However, the high court raised concerns over the ability of the legislature to survive without funding and ordered the two sides into mediation, which ended in an impasse. Gazelka said it was imperative for the court to step in again.  “The people of Minnesota will no longer have a voice in the legislative branch after the first of the year, not to mention the pain inflicted on our employees,” he said. In a September court filing, the House of Representatives said it anticipated running out of money on Feb. 1. ",Minnesota Senate may halt operations on Dec. 1 due to funding dispute
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical company executive, is U.S. President Donald Trump’s top pick to run the Department of Health and Human Services, two sources with knowledge of the confidential process said on condition of anonymity on Wednesday. Azar served at Eli Lilly for a decade, including five years as president of its U.S. Lilly USA, LLC unit. The White House declined to comment. Tom Price resigned as HHS secretary in September after about seven months in the post, after facing sharp criticism for his use of taxpayer-funded private travel.  Before his stint at Eli Lilly, Azar served as general counsel and deputy secretary for HHS under President George W. Bush. The new HHS secretary will be tasked with implementing Trump administration efforts to unwind Obamacare, a top campaign promise of his, and overseeing the drug industry, which Trump has said is “getting away with murder” by charging high prices for prescription medications. Azar has served on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a drug industry lobby, for several years, and his nomination would raise questions about the administration’s seriousness about lowering drug prices. Other names that have been floated to replace Price include  Seema Verma, administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and Scott Gottlieb, the Food and Drug Administration commissioner. Republicans control both chambers of Congress and the White House but have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obama’s Affordable Care Act, prompting Trump to take steps on his own to dismantle the program. The Trump administration followed through on a threat to cut off billions of dollars of subsidy payments to insurers, shortened the Obamacare open enrollment period, slashed advertising for the program by 90 percent and cut funding to groups that help people sign up for health insurance.  In October Trump also signed an executive order that would weaken Obamacare by making it easier for Americans to buy bare-bones health insurance plans. The administration is already planning changes for 2019. Last month, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. Under Obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.    ",Ex-pharma exec Azar is top choice to run U.S. health agency: sources
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. voters picked climate change advocates in a handful of gubernatorial and state legislature races on Tuesday, providing a potential boost to state-level efforts to fight global warming through carbon trading schemes. Democratic-led state and local governments have already promised to act as a counterweight to the administration of President Donald Trump, which is seeking to unwind climate change regulations it deems too costly, and remove the United States from a global pact to reduce emissions.  Democrat Phil Murphy won his race on Tuesday night to succeed New Jersey’s outgoing Republican Governor Chris Christie. Murphy ran on a platform that included a pledge to “immediately restore New Jersey’s place in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),” a northeast carbon market from which Christie withdrew in 2011. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespe and pledged to carry out outgoing Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe’s executive directive to reduce carbon emissions and “allow Virginia to become trading-ready.” RGGI Chair Katie Dykes said its officials had been communicating with Virginia as it developed greenhouse gas regulations, and welcomed the “potential dialogue with New Jersey.” In Washington state, a victory by Democrat Manka Dhingra in a state Senate district flipped control of the legislature to Democrats, a boost to Democratic Governor Jay Inslee’s plan to join California, Quebec and Ontario in a carbon trading scheme.  RGGI and the western state carbon market were formed more than a decade ago to help develop market-based approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The addition of Virginia and New Jersey to RGGI would be significant. In 2016, New Jersey emitted 22.1 million short tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) while Virginia emitted 38 million. RGGI’s current nine states emitted 90 million short tons in 2016. RGGI holds quarterly auctions for carbon permits, which have yielded $2.8 billion in proceeds to date, intended for use to finance clean energy and energy efficiency projects. Environmental advocates said state-level developments could help counter the Trump administration, as its seeks to revive the U.S. coal industry and roll back environmental protections enacted by Democratic former President Barack Obama. “We are seeing growing momentum on climate action at the state level,” said Jackson Morris, an official at the Natural Resources Defense Council. A White House official did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ",Democratic wins in U.S. state elections boost hopes for carbon trading
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Donald Trump’s nominee to head the Department of Homeland Security told a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday there was no need to build a wall on the Mexican border “from sea to shining sea” in remarks that contrasted with the president’s campaign pledge. Kirstjen Nielsen repeated at her confirmation hearing what her predecessor, John Kelly, had said about the project. Kelly, Nielsen’s former boss, stepped down as head of the department this year to be Trump’s chief of staff. Building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border was one of Trump’s central campaign promises but so far only prototypes have been built as funding remains in question.  Nielsen, 45, served as Kelly’s deputy in the White House and before that as his chief of staff when he was secretary of homeland security in the opening months of Trump’s presidency. In response to questions from senators on the Homeland Security Committee, Nielsen said she would work with “state and local actors on the ground” to find the best solutions for border security, including increasing the use of technology such as unmanned surveillance aircraft. The ranking Democrat on the committee, Senator Claire McCaskill, raised concerns that no cost-benefit analysis had been done on the need for the wall as compared to other homeland security initiatives facing cuts in the president’s budget. “These decisions shouldn’t be based on politics,” McCaskill said at the hearing. Nielsen responded that any decision about resources needed to be “risk based.”  If confirmed by the Senate, Nielsen would take the reins at a department with more than 240,000 employees that is responsible for issues such as U.S. border and airport security, immigration policy, disaster response and refugee admissions. She is a cyber security expert and highlighted those concerns in her opening remarks. “Cyber criminals and nation states are continually looking for ways to exploit our hyperconnectivity,” Nielsen said. A day before the hearing a bipartisan group of dozens of former U.S. Homeland Security officials sent letters supporting her nomination. Nielsen served in the administration of Republican President George W. Bush as Special Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and was involved in revising disaster relief policies after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. When asked by another Democratic senator whether she believed humans were the primary cause of climate change, which scientists have linked to worsening natural disasters, Nielsen said: “I do absolutely believe that the climate is changing and that there are many contributions”.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Ralph Northam won a bitter race for Virginia governor on Tuesday, dealing a setback to President Donald Trump with a decisive victory over a Republican who had adopted some of the president’s combative tactics and issues. Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, overcame a barrage of attack ads by Republican Ed Gillespie that hit the soft-spoken Democrat on divisive issues such as immigration, gang crime and Confederate statues. Trump, who endorsed Gillespie but did not campaign with him, had taken a break from his Asia trip to send tweets and record messages on Tuesday supporting the former chairman of the Republican National Committee. But after the outcome, Trump quickly distanced himself from Gillespie. “Ed Gillespie worked hard but did not embrace me or what I stand for,” Trump tweeted. “With the economy doing record numbers, we will continue to win, even bigger than before!” At his victory party, Northam told supporters the sweeping Democratic win in Virginia sent a message to the country. “Virginia has told us to end the divisiveness, that we will not condone hatred and bigotry, and to end the politics that have torn this country apart,” Northam said. The Virginia race highlighted a slate of state and local elections that also included a governor’s race in New Jersey, where Democrat Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and ambassador to Germany, defeated Republican Kim Guadagno for the right to succeed Republican Chris Christie. Murphy had promised to be a check on Trump in Democratic-leaning New Jersey. Guadagno, the lieutenant governor, was hampered by her association with the unpopular Christie. Murphy’s win and the Northam victory in Virginia, a state Democrat Hillary Clinton won by 5 percentage points in the 2016 presidential election, provided a much-needed boost for national Democrats who were desperate to turn grassroots resistance to Trump into election victories. Democrats had already lost four special congressional elections earlier this year. But a strong turnout in the Democratic-leaning northern Virginia suburbs of Washington helped propel Northam, who in the end won relatively easily. With nearly all precincts reporting, he led by a 53 percent to 45 percent margin. Exit polls in Virginia showed that one-third of the voters went to the polls to oppose Trump, and only 17 percent went to support him. Democrats also swept the other top statewide Virginia races, winning the offices of lieutenant governor and attorney general, and gained seats in the Virginia House of Delegates. Democrat Danica Roem beat a long-time Republican incumbent to become the first transgender person to win a state legislative race.     “This is a comprehensive political victory from statehouse to courthouse. Thank you Donald Trump!” Democratic U.S. Representative Gerald Connolly of Virginia told Northam’s supporters at a victory party in northern Virginia. In Virginia, Democrats had worried that if Gillespie won, Republicans would see it as a green light to emphasize divisive cultural issues in their campaigns for next year’s elections, when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives and 33 of the U.S. Senate’s 100 seats come up for election. Republicans now control both chambers. Gillespie, speaking to crestfallen supporters in Richmond, Virginia, said he had run a “very policy-focused campaign.” But voters in Arlington County - a suburban Democratic stronghold bordering Washington - said national politics were important to their votes. “Trump talks about draining the swamp, but Gillespie kind of is the swamp,” said Nick Peacemaker, who works in marketing and considered himself a Republican until Trump won the party’s presidential nomination.  Peacemaker said Gillespie seemed to shift closer to Trump’s policies after securing the Republican gubernatorial nomination.  In local races across the country, Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio in New York and Marty Walsh in Boston both easily won re-election. Voters were also picking mayors in Detroit, Atlanta, Seattle and Charlotte, North Carolina. ",Democrats win bitter Virginia governor's race in setback for Trump

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - With lavish pageantry and an uncharacteristic personal flourish, Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday rolled out a red carpet welcome for U.S President Donald Trump at the Forbidden City, the ancient home of China’s emperors. While North Korea and trade are set to dominate the formal part of the visit, which ends on Friday, China has been keen to show the importance it puts on Trump’s visit, the first by a foreign leader since the end of a key Communist Party congress last month where Xi cemented his power. Trump and his wife Melania were whisked from Beijing airport - where they were met by China’s top diplomat Yang Jiechi, a key player in the outreach to Trump since he won election a year ago - straight to the Forbidden City. Chatting over cups of tea, Trump showed Xi a video of his granddaughter Arabella Kushner singing in Mandarin and reciting classical Chinese poetry, prompting Xi to compliment her performance as worthy of an “A+”, Chinese state media said.  Xi said he hoped Arabella would visit China soon, noting that she was already a “child star” in China, the official Xinhua news agency said. A video of Arabella reciting a Chinese poem went viral on Chinese social media shortly after Trump’s election last year. In another break from precedent, Xi himself gave the Trumps a tour of the imperial treasures of the Forbidden City, a UNESCO World Heritage site cleared of tourists for the day, before the two first couples watched Chinese opera and an acrobatic display. “That’s something!” Trump said after the show, as he and Xi walked away. “We’re having a great time.” China had widely been expected to pull out all the stops for Trump, who has pressed it to do more to control its neighbor North Korea, and resolve a yawning trade gap with the United States.  The ceremony on Trump’s arrival at Beijing’s airport on Wednesday was also more elaborate than usual, with the Trumps met by a marching band and soldiers standing at attention. Smartly dressed children waving miniature Chinese and American flags jumped up and down as Trump’s motorcade passed.  In another rare, if not unprecedented step, Trump’s official ceremonial welcome at the Great Hall of the People on Thursday will be broadcast live on national television, state broadcaster CCTV said. While the sprawling palace complex in the center of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to provide a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives introduced bills on Wednesday to toughen U.S. foreign investment rules amid growing concern about Chinese efforts to buy U.S. high-tech companies. Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, introduced a Senate bill to broaden the government’s power to stop foreign purchases of U.S. firms by strengthening the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Representative Robert Pittenger, a North Carolina Republican, introduced an identical bill in the U.S. House of Representatives. Both bills have Republican and Democratic co-sponsors. “This bill focuses on providing CFIUS with updated tools to address present and future security needs,” said Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat. “Senator Cornyn and I have been working on this bill for the last eight months, and we hope to build on the progress we’ve already made to update CFIUS and address national security threats.” In addition to Cornyn, of Texas, and Feinstein, cosponsors of the Senate bill include Republicans Marco Rubio of Florida, John Barrasso of Wyoming, James Lankford of Oklahoma and Tim Scott of South Carolina. Democratic co-sponsors are Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Gary Peters of Michigan and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. “China is buying American companies at a breathtaking pace.  While some are legitimate business investments, many others are part of a backdoor effort to compromise U.S. national security,” said Pittenger in a press statement. House co-sponsors include Republicans Devin Nunes of  California, Chris Smith of New Jersey and Sam Johnson and John Culberson, both of whom are from Texas. House Democrats backing the bill are Denny Heck of Washington and Dave Loebsack from Iowa. “That’s a pretty powerful collection of members, which makes me think it’s got a good shot (at becoming law),” said Seth Bloom, a former general counsel on a Senate Judiciary Committee subcommittee. The bills would expand CFIUS’ reach to allow it to review, and potentially reject, smaller investments and add new national security factors for CFIUS to consider. Those factors include whether information about Americans, such as Social Security numbers, would be exposed as part of the transaction or whether the deal would facilitate fraud. The bills would also allow CFIUS to exempt certain transactions from review if the investors are from a country that is a treaty ally or has another security arrangement with the United States. CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals involving China in particular, and has blocked transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors. It has become more cautious since President Donald Trump was inaugurated amid growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. Since the inauguration, the panel has balked at approving a broader range of deals from China, according to lawyers who specialize in representing proposed transactions to the board.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Members of U.S. congressional defense committees said on Wednesday they supported a plan for $700 billion in defense spending in fiscal year 2018, backing President Donald Trump’s call for a boost for the military.   The House of Representatives and the Senate Armed Services committees agreed on the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which would increase troop levels and purchases of fighter jets and ships for the federal fiscal year that began on Oct. 1. The act would increase active troop levels by more than 16,000 and includes plans to buy 90 stealthy F-35 fighter jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp. The spending plan is larger than the $603 billion in spending proposed by Trump in May. Trump wants to pay for a military spending increase by slashing non-defense spending.  The Trump proposal included funding for the Department of Defense as well as nuclear weapons programs at the Department of Energy and other national defense programs.  Senior staff for the Armed Services committees said the NDAA gives $634 billion for the same programs, with total defense spending, including the Pentagon and defense related programs at the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies to $699.6 billion.  The Pentagon alone would get $692 billion of that, including $65.7 billion for ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.  To become law the NDAA must be passed by both the House and Senate and signed into law by Trump. The bill, one of the few pieces of legislation that gets through Congress every year, has passed every year since 1961. The request for defense spending is well beyond last year’s $619 billion, defying “sequestration” spending caps set in the 2011 Budget Control Act. The caps would need to be lifted before the 2018 spending could be approved. In addition to more active-duty troops, the spending plan incorporates additional money recently requested for missile defense.[nL1N1NC20Q] The proposal also gives the Navy authorization for an additional five ships above Trump’s original budget request. The ships include an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer made by General Dynamics Corp and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc and a total of three Littoral Combat Ships built by Lockheed Martin and Australia’s Austal Ltd.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in China on Wednesday seeking help to rein in North Korea, telling the reclusive state’s leader he was putting his country in grave danger by developing nuclear weapons. Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.” “Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit. Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations. Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.” He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do. “We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.” The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.     “The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region. ‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’ In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance. While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.   Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures. During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul. He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed. The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official. Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added. Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday. Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties. “To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said. While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions. During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.” However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach. North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving. “North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.  He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader. Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.” The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said. A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea. Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub. And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official. “The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One. “I’m sure we’ve got the gear aboard this airplane to make it happen.” ",Trump warns 'rogue regime' North Korea of grave danger
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Meetings between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing this week will focus on addressing trade imbalances between the two countries, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Wednesday.  Ross was speaking at a signing ceremony in the Chinese capital for commercial deals worth about $9 billion on Trump’s visit. Trump has ratcheted up his criticism of China’s massive trade surplus with the U.S. - calling it “embarrassing” and “horrible” last week - and has accused Beijing of unfair trade practices, fuelling worries of increased tension between the world’s two largest trading countries. “Addressing the imbalance in China trade has been the central focus of collaborative discussions between President Trump and President Xi and achieving fair and reciprocal treatment for the companies is a shared objective,” Ross said. Data on Wednesday showed China’s exports to the U.S. rose 8.3 percent in October on the year, while imports grew 4.3 percent. That led to a trade surplus of $26.62 billion with the U.S. last month, down from September’s record $28.08 billion, but higher than recent trends. Deals signed on Wednesday included a pledge by Chinese ecommerce company JD.com  to buy more than $2 billion of food products from the U.S. over three years and a pact for Reignwood International to buy additional helicopters from U.S. firm Bell Helicopter.  While 19 deals were signed on Wednesday, some in the U.S. business community have expressed worry that contract wins could come at the expense of resolving long-standing complaints over market access restrictions in China. At the ceremony, China’s vice premier Wang Yang said deals signed between China and U.S. firms would “contribute to the stabilization of the general and overall economic relations between the two countries”. The ceremony was a prelude to a “more important” signing ceremony set for Thursday, he added. Among the companies expected to sign deals on Thursday are Qualcomm, Boeing and Goldman Sachs. Chinese commerce minister Zhong Shan also attended the event in the Great Hall of the People next to Tiananmen Square. ",Commerce Secretary says Trump-Xi talks will address trade imbalances
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The latest attempt to overhaul the U.S. federal flood insurance program hit a stumbling block, but a coalition of business and environmental groups renewed their push on Wednesday for lawmakers to enact an overhaul before the program expires on Dec. 8. The SmarterSafer coalition sent a letter to members of the U.S. House urging passage of the compromise legislation that would extend to 2022 the federal program that has been heavily utilized after vast flooding from hurricanes Harvey and Irma. “This legislative package moves the flood program in the right direction and contains needed reforms that will better protect those in harm’s way, the environment, and taxpayers,” the letter states, according to a copy seen by Reuters.  The hurdle came with the House Rules Committee indefinitely postponed a hearing on the bill that was scheduled for Tuesday night. “Clearly they’re trying to make sure they’ve got all their ducks in a row and they’ve got all the votes they need,” said Steve Ellis, with the conservative group Taxpayers for Common Sense, which is part of a coalition pushing for reform of the program.  Joshua Saks, the legislative director of the National Wildlife Federation, said one of the shortcomings of the compromise is that it does not ensure that the money for flood mitigation projects will ever be spent.  “We need an Apollo project of mitigation right now, we need billions right now up front,” Saks said, referring to the project that put a man on the moon. Two prominent Republican members of the U.S. House announced last week they had struck a deal that would extend the life of the program that covers most of the nation’s flood-prone properties. House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana and House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling of Texas brokered the compromise and said the deal helps policy holders and taxpayers. Last month, President Donald Trump signed a $36.5 billion disaster relief bill, including $16 billion in forgiveness of some debt in the National Flood Insurance Program, which insures about 5 million homes and businesses.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - The White House on Wednesday condemned missile attacks by Yemen’s Houthi militias on Saudi Arabia, saying they threatened the region’s security and undermined efforts to halt the conflict. Saudi Arabia said its air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired from warring Yemen over the capital Riyadh on Saturday. The rocket was brought down near King Khaled Airport on the northern outskirts of the capital. Saudi Arabia’s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said Iran’s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen was an act of “direct military aggression” that could be an act of war. “Houthi missile attacks against Saudi Arabia, enabled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, threaten regional security and undermine UN efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict,” the White House said in a statement as U.S. President Donald Trump began a visit to the Chinese capital.  “These missile systems were not present in Yemen before the conflict, and we call upon the United Nations to conduct a thorough examination of evidence that the Iranian regime is perpetuating the war in Yemen to advance its regional ambitions,” the statement added.   It said the United States would continue working with other “like-minded” partners to respond to such attacks and expose what it called Iran’s destabilizing activities in the region. Iran denied it was behind the missile launch. On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said missile attacks from Yemen were a reaction to what he called Saudi aggression. In reaction to the missile, the Saudi-led coalition closed all air, land and sea ports to the impoverished country. It also intensified air strikes on areas controlled by the Houthis including the capital Sanaa. The war has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered one of the worst man-made humanitarian disasters in recent history.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio scored a decisive victory on Tuesday in his bid to secure a second four-year term in charge of the United States’ biggest city. With more than 75 percent of the city’s voting precincts reporting, de Blasio, 56, had won nearly 65 percent, a margin of 35 percentage points over his Republican opponent, state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, according to New York City’s Board of Elections. The New York Times and other media called the race for de Blasio. De Blasio, who held a comfortable lead in opinion polls leading up to Election Day, had been widely expected to cruise to victory in a city of 8.5 million people dominated by Democratic voters.  A progressive liberal, de Blasio in the past week campaigned with U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent. Sanders backed de Blasio’s call for a tax hike on city residents earning more than $500,000 a year, a measure with little chance of passing the state legislature in Albany. The mayor has positioned himself as one of the most vocal critics of Republican President Donald Trump, who has received strong disapproval ratings from voters in his native city. Daisy Taberas, 71, who immigrated from Peru 48 years ago, said she voted for de Blasio because of her concerns over Trump’s stance on immigration. “I like the way (de Blasio) works with children in the schools, and he’s trying to protect the city and he cares about immigration,” Taberas said after casting her ballot at a Manhattan polling site.  De Blasio has taken heat for problems in the city’s aging subway system, the largest in the United States. The mayor, who has faced complaints over rising disruptions and delays on the subway system, has emphasized that it is run by a state-controlled authority, not the city. He has also been plagued by accusations of a pay-to-play culture within City Hall. A former donor, Jona Rechnitz, recently testified at the corruption trial of a union boss that he established a direct line to the de Blasio administration after raising money for the mayor’s election campaign in 2013. After years of investigation, federal prosecutors said in March they would not charge de Blasio, a point he reiterated on the campaign trail. The mayor campaigned on his efforts to increase affordable housing, establish universal pre-kindergarten for 4-year-olds and maintain the city’s historically low crime rates.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has divested his interests in oil tanker company Diamond S Shipping and is in the process of selling off his holdings in another shipping firm, Navigator Holdings, a Trump administration official said on Tuesday. Ross had originally intended to retain his shipping interests following his confirmation in February. But the 79-year-old investor came under criticism after disclosures on Sunday that one of Navigator’s major clients is the Russian gas company Sibur, a firm whose owners include members of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle. Information about the business ties between Navigator, which operates gas-carrying ships, and Sibur was based on leaked documents from offshore law firm Appleby that are part of the so-called Paradise Papers, which show details of business dealings by wealthy people and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L). Reuters has not independently verified the documents. “He began divesting his Navigator interests in May,” the administration official said of Ross. “He is nearing completion of that process.” An office of government ethics disclosure filed by Ross on June 20 showed that he sold an interest in Navigator valued at $15,001 to $50,000 on May 30. The official did not provide an explanation for Ross’s divestitures. Ross had owned stakes in the firms through several partnerships. Ross, a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy, had told U.S. senators during his confirmation hearing in January that his research showed that retention of shipping interests would not present a conflict of interest. U.S. ocean shipping regulation is handled by the Federal Maritime Commission, a separate, independent agency. Diamond S Shipping, based in Greenwich, Connecticut, operates 33 petroleum product tankers and 12 crude oil tankers operated under the flags of Hong Kong, the Marshall Islands and Malta. Ross told media on Monday that he had nothing to do with London-based Navigator’s relationship with Sibur and had never met any of Sibur’s owners. These include Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate who is subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions. Ross said in multiple media interviews that he had fully disclosed his stake in Navigator Holdings as part of government ethics requirements.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will ask China to cut its financial links with North Korea and to abide by U.N. sanctions when meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing, a senior White House official said on Wednesday. Trump arrived in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon from South Korea for a two-night stop in the Chinese capital as part of his marathon Asia tour. The U.S. president was undecided on whether to declare North Korea a state sponsor of terrorism by the end of his trip, the official said, speaking to reporters on-board Air Force One. Trump believes any talks with the North would require reducing threats, ending provocations and movement toward denuclearization and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearisation, the official added.

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Voters in Maine on Tuesday approved a ballot initiative to expand the state’s Medicaid program under Obamacare, sending a clear signal of support for the federal healthcare law to lawmakers in the state and Washington D.C.   The approval of the ballot question in Maine comes after Republicans in Washington failed several times over the last few months to pass legislation that would dismantle the Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law. Maine has recently figured prominently in the nation’s debate on how to reform healthcare. U.S. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate Republican from Maine, helped block her party’s efforts to repeal Obamacare this year, which angered President Donald Trump.  Maine, which becomes the first U.S. state to approve Medicaid expansion by ballot initiative, is one of 19 states that has not expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.  About 60 percent of voters in Maine approved the ballot initiative, according to the Bangor Daily News newspaper.   Tuesday’s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverage under Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.  The state’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, staunchly opposes expansion of federal health care insurance, vetoing legislation to do so on several occasions.   “I’ve said it before, “free” is very expensive to somebody,” LePage said in a radio address last week.   About 70,000 residents in Maine would be eligible for the state’s Medicaid program when and if state officials certify the results of the election. Lawmakers could vote to repeal or alter the referendum, much like they have recently for several citizen-initiated referendums, the Bangor Daily News reported.   “It is now the responsibility and the duty of the governor and the legislature to fully and faithfully implement this law,” the state’s Speaker of the House, Sara Gideon, said in a statement.  The Legislature’s Office of Fiscal and Program Review in Maine estimated that expansion of Medicaid would cost the state about $55 million and bring in about $525 million of federal money to the state each year, according to the Bangor Daily News.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives forged ahead on Tuesday with legislation to reshape the federal tax code, while a top credit-ratings agency said the bill would balloon the budget deficit and give only a temporary boost to the economy. As the House tax committee weighed amendments to a bill that Democrats have blasted as a give-away to corporations and the rich, the Washington tax reform debate was fast shifting to the Senate, where Republicans hold only a slim majority. Senate Republicans are expected to unveil their own tax bill at the end of the week, and early indications suggest it could differ significantly from the House legislation. The House is aiming to vote on its bill next week, a senior Republican said. Tax reform has been a priority for President Donald Trump, who says it will stimulate economic growth. But Republicans have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment since Trump took office in January, even though the party controls both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. Trump made another pitch for Democratic support on Capitol Hill, where his top aides met with about a dozen Senate Democrats and Trump himself phoned in from his Asia trip. “He said, ‘Look … I want to do it in a bipartisan way,’” Senator Joe Donnelly told reporters.  Fitch Ratings predicted that a Republican tax plan would win passage in both chambers, but did not see it offering long-term benefits. “Such reform would deliver a modest and temporary spur to growth. ... However, it will lead to wider fiscal deficits and add significantly to U.S. government debt,” Fitch said, revising up its medium-term U.S. government debt forecast. The U.S. national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. Republicans once firmly opposed adding to the debt, but their emphasis has changed. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) said the House bill would add nearly $1.5 trillion to the national debt from 2018 through 2027. Trump and congressional Republicans say the proposed tax cuts would boost economic growth enough to generate new revenues that would offset the tax cuts. Few economists agree. The House bill slashes tax rates for large corporations, small businesses and wealthy Americans, while sharply reducing or eliminating tax breaks that benefit many middle-class Americans such as deductions for state and local taxes, college tuition and home mortgage interest. JCT estimates that the House bill could raise taxes on as many as 38 million people who earn between $20,000 and $40,000 per year, beginning in 2023. House Republicans, who have an overwhelming majority, drafted their bill in secret, ignoring Democrats.  But the House bill is unlikely to be taken up in the Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 seat majority and they need to pay heed to moderates within their own ranks as well as Democrats, lobbyists and analysts said. Two conservative Republican senators, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, have already voiced concern that the House tax bill could raise taxes on some middle-class Americans.   The Senate bill could delay the proposed corporate tax cut by one year, may not allow any deductions for local property taxes, and may not collapse the current seven individual brackets to the four proposed by the House, according to the Washington Post.  Republican leaders have pushed for the House to vote on the tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. “My donors are basically saying, get it done or don’t ever call me again,” Republican Representative Chris Collins said.         U.S. tax legislation must begin in the House. “We’ll bring it to the floor next week,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News. In party-line votes on Tuesday, Brady’s tax committee voted down eight Democratic amendments that would have preserved or expanded tax breaks for the middle class, nullified the tax legislation if it increased the deficit in future years and maintained taxes on foreign profits of U.S. corporations. Brady offered a sweeping amendment on Monday that tweaked at least half a dozen provisions of the 425-page bill.  One related to carried interest income, a share of an investment fund’s profits paid out to the fund’s general partners and which represents a large portion of many fund managers’ incomes. Carried interest currently is taxed at the capital gains rate, which is substantially lower than the personal income tax rate for higher earners. Brady’s amendment would lengthen to more than three years from one the time period assets must be held in order to be eligible for the capital gains tax rate. The amendment would also reduce the amount of carried-interest income eligible for the lower rate. ",Republican tax plans gain speed; Fitch warns on deficit

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A peace activist who laughed at then U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions during his confirmation hearing to become U.S. attorney general will no longer be prosecuted on charges of disrupting a session of Congress and demonstrating at the Capitol. The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia filed court papers on Monday, notifying a judge her office was dropping its case against Desiree Fairooz, a children’s librarian. Fairooz had faced up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if she were convicted on both charges at trial. She belonged to Code Pink, an anti-war group that often stages protests against politicians. The group accused federal prosecutors of overreaching and wasting money on the case.  “We hope they will scale back this massive overreach and that the success we just saw in Desiree’s case will encourage more people to protest in the halls of Congress and on the streets,” Code Pink said in a statement on Tuesday.  Fairooz laughed during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in January, after a lawmaker’s asserted Sessions treated all Americans equally. It was at the confirmation hearing for Sessions, who was then a Republican senator from Alabama and was later confirmed to become U.S. attorney general. Fairooz shouted, “This man is evil, pure evil” as police led her away. A jury found Fairooz guilty in May of disrupting a session of Congress and demonstrating on Capitol grounds.  But a judge for the District of Columbia Superior Court overturned the guilty verdict in July and ordered a new trial. Chief Judge Robert Morin found it was unclear whether Fairooz was convicted for laughter or for speaking out as she was removed, Fairooz’s attorney, Samuel Bogash, said at the time. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia said in an email on Tuesday that his office had no comment on the decision to dismiss the case.  A second trial for Fairooz had been scheduled for Nov. 13, but Morin canceled it after prosecutors dropped the case. ",Charges dropped against woman who laughed at Trump nominee Sessions

0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China and the United States have common interests but the relationship needs careful handling, Chinese state-run media said on Wednesday ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to Beijing. North Korea and trade are expected to dominate Trump’s trip, with the U.S. leader likely to push Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to rein in Pyongyang’s nuclear and missile programs and address China’s large trade surplus with the United States. The ruling Communist Party’s official People’s Daily said in a commentary that as China becomes strong, it won’t repeat “old fashioned zero-sum thinking” in handling ties, but will work with the United States to construct a cooperative and mutually profitable relationship with no conflict. “In realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and protecting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, China and the United States have common interests,” it said. “The two sides should respect one another’s interests, maintain close communication and consultation, and make unremitting efforts to promote a thorough resolution of the Korean Peninsula nuclear issue.” Trump heads to China later on Wednesday after visiting Japan and South Korea in the first legs of his marathon Asian tour. Trump’s attempt to make a surprise visit to the heavily fortified border separating North Korea and South Korea was aborted on Wednesday after dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing at the doorstep of the North Korean nuclear standoff. The China Daily, in an editorial which preceded the announcement of the abortive Trump trip to the border, said Trump not going to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) and North Korea not recently carrying out any nuclear or missile tests was a “hopeful sign that both prefer to find a peaceful solution to their predicaments”.  China has promised a “state visit plus” for Trump, and while having not released any details, Beijing is attaching great importance to the visit. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi. “Such hospitality is rarely seen in modern China,” influential tabloid the Global Times, published by the People’s Daily, said in its editorial.  “Beijing’s enthusiasm reflects the most positive part of the attitude that the diversified world holds toward the U.S., and the realistic international outlook of the rising China.”     ",Chinese media upbeat on U.S. ties ahead of Trump visit
0,True,"November 8, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in China on Wednesday seeking help to rein in North Korea, telling the reclusive state’s leader he was putting his country in grave danger by developing nuclear weapons. Trump used some of his toughest language yet against North Korea in a wide-ranging address in Seoul that lodged specific accusations of chilling human rights abuses. He called on countries around the world to isolate Pyongyang by denying it “any form of support, supply or acceptance.” “Do not underestimate us and do not try us,” Trump told North Korea as he wrapped up a visit to South Korea with a speech to the National Assembly before heading to Beijing, where he was making his first official visit. Trump painted a dystopian picture of the reclusive North, saying people were suffering in “gulags” and some bribed government officials to work as “slaves” overseas rather than live under the government at home. He offered no evidence to support those accusations. Trump’s return to harsh, uncompromising language came a day after he appeared to dial back the bellicose rhetoric that had fueled fears across east Asia of the risk of military conflict. On Tuesday, Trump had even offered a diplomatic opening to Pyongyang to “make a deal.” He went mostly on the attack in Wednesday’s speech but did promise a “path to a much better future” if North Korea stopped developing ballistic missiles and agreed to “complete, verifiable and total denuclearization” – something Pyongyang has vowed never to do. “We will not allow American cities to be threatened with destruction. We will not be intimidated,” he told South Korean lawmakers. “And we will not let the worst atrocities in history be repeated here, on this ground we fought and died to secure.” The North defends its nuclear weapons and missile programs as a necessary defense against what it says are U.S. plans to invade. The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.     “The world cannot tolerate the menace of a rogue regime that threatens it with nuclear devastation,” Trump said, speaking as three U.S. aircraft carrier groups sailed to the Western Pacific for exercises - a rare show of such U.S. naval force in the region. ‘STATE VISIT-PLUS’ In Beijing, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping resumed their “bromance” struck in April at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, making small talk as they toured the Forbidden City - which was shut down to tourists - with their wives before taking in a Chinese opera performance. While the sprawling palace complex in the political and cultural heart of Beijing is a regular stop for visiting dignitaries, it is rare for a Chinese leader to act as a personal escort, confirmation of the “state visit-plus” treatment that China had promised for Trump.   Trump has threatened action over China’s wide trade surplus with the United States and called on Beijing to do more to rein in ally and neighbor North Korea, but has expressed admiration for Xi and held off on imposing trade measures. During his two-day visit, Trump will ask China to abide by U.N. resolutions and cut financial links with North Korea, a senior White House official said on the plane from Seoul. He also plans to discuss with Xi the long-contentious trade imbalance, U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said at a ceremony with U.S. business leaders where $9 billion worth of deals were signed. The White House expects to announce deals in China this week worth more than $250 billion, Bloomberg reported, citing an administration official. Trump believes any talks with North Korea would require it to reduce threats, end provocations and move toward denuclearization, and that no deal can be achieved without denuclearization, the official added. Trump and Xi were scheduled to hold formal talks on Thursday. Before leaving for Beijing, Trump cited China as one of the countries that must fully enforce international sanctions against Pyongyang and downgrade diplomatic and commercial ties. “To those nations that choose to ignore this threat or, worse still, to enable it, the weight of this crisis is on your conscience,” he said. While Trump will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports and financial transactions, it is not clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China has repeatedly said its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West and that it is already doing all it can to enforce sanctions. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said that China fully and strictly implements U.N. Security Council resolutions on North Korea, but will investigate if there have been any contraventions. During his speech in Seoul, Trump directed his words at North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “The weapons that you are acquiring are not making you safer, they are putting your regime in grave danger,” he said. “Every step you take down this dark path increases the peril you face.” However Trump, whose strategy has stressed sanctions and military pressure instead of diplomacy, did not spell out any new approach. North Korea has made clear it has little interest in negotiations at least until it develops a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, something U.S. intelligence officials say it may be just months away from achieving. “North Korea is a country ruled by a cult,” Trump said in a speech that was interrupted several times by applause and ended with a standing ovation.  He stopped short of repeating the derisive nickname “little Rocket Man” that he has used to describe the young North Korean leader. Kim, for his part, has called Trump “mentally deranged.” The speech came after Trump’s attempt to make an unannounced visit to the heavily fortified border separating North and South Korea was aborted when dense fog prevented his helicopter from landing, officials said. A visit to the DMZ, despite his aides’ earlier insistence he had no plans to go there, would have had the potential to further inflame tensions with North Korea. Arriving in Beijing on Wednesday, Trump and his wife Melania descended from a red-carpeted staircase rolled up to the main door of Air Force One. That was in contrast to a 2016 visit to China by his predecessor, Barack Obama, who was forced to exit his plane from a lower door in what was seen as a snub. And while in China, Trump will not be deterred from using Twitter, his favored form of communication, despite its being banned there, according to an administration official. “The president will tweet whatever he wants,” the official told reporters on Air Force One. “I’m sure we’ve got the gear aboard this airplane to make it happen.” ",Trump warns 'rogue regime' North Korea of grave danger

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Banking Committee unanimously backed new sanctions targeting Chinese banks that do business with North Korea on Tuesday, just before President Donald Trump visits Beijing for the first time since taking office. As well as strengthening existing sanctions and congressional oversight, the measure will target foreign financial institutions - in China and elsewhere - that provide services to those subject to North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential order or U.N. Security Council resolution.   All 12 Republicans and 11 Democrats on the panel voted for the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea (BRINK) Act,” clearing the way for its consideration by the full Senate. The bill was named after a U.S. student who died earlier this year after he was imprisoned in North Korea, further chilling already poor relations between Washington and Pyongyang. “For too long, we’ve been complacent about the growing and gathering threat from the North Korean regime,” Republican Pat Toomey, one of the bill’s authors, said after the committee voted. Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, another author, said that in addition to Chinese banks, Malaysian financial institutions might end up in its sights. Trump is due to wrap up a visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea, and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang. Some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, as well as many Democrats, have been critical of Trump’s bellicose rhetoric about North Korea, and have called for the use of economic tools like sanctions or more negotiations before talking of war. Washington so far has largely held off on imposing new sanctions against Chinese banks and companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. Van Hollen told reporters on Monday ahead of the committee vote that he wished Trump would follow the model of President Theodore Roosevelt and “speak softly and carry a big stick,” adding: “We’re trying to give him a little bigger stick with the sanctions.” Republican and Democratic lawmakers said last week they had reached a bipartisan agreement on the sanctions bill. A companion bill has been introduced in the House of Representatives. The leaders of the Republican-led Senate have not said when the chamber might vote on the legislation.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Democratic Senator said on Tuesday he wants answers from top Justice Department officials about why a career prosecutor was asked to resign days before a special counsel unveiled the first criminal charges in an investigation into Russia’s role in the 2016 U.S. election. Dana Boente was asked to quit in late October as the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, whose district has played an important role in the investigation. Just days later, Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators charged President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide, Rick Gates, with conspiring to launder money and other charges. It was also announced on Oct. 30 that a third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty earlier in the month to a charge of lying to the FBI. U.S. Senator Chris Coons, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he was writing to U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to ask if Boente’s departure was “normal or justified.” “I’m concerned about the abrupt departure of Dana Boente after a career as a federal prosecutor ... There’s a lot of circumstances that connect the ongoing Mueller investigation to the Eastern District,” Coons said in an interview.  A Department of Justice spokesman said the agency does not comment on personnel matters. Boente could not immediately be reached for comment. Investigations into whether Republican Trump’s campaign associates colluded with Russia last year to help him defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for the presidency arose after U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia carried out a campaign of hacking and propaganda to interfere in the election. Russia has repeatedly denied meddling allegations and Trump has denied any collusion. A Justice Department veteran, Boente has stepped in to help stabilize the law enforcement agency in frequent periods of turmoil during the first year of the Trump administration. Boente has also been temporarily serving as the acting assistant attorney general for the department’s National Security Division. He previously was acting attorney general after Trump fired the prosecutor in that post, Sally Yates. After that, Boente also briefly was acting deputy attorney general. A person familiar with the matter confirmed that Sessions, a former Alabama Republican senator and close Trump ally, asked Boente to tender his resignation in late October. Boente will step down as head of the National Security Division once Trump’s nominee John Demers is confirmed by the Senate. After that, Boente will continue as head of the Eastern District in Alexandria, Virginia, until he is replaced. Trump has not yet nominated anyone for that post.  The Eastern District post is the fourth most powerful position in the department’s line of succession. A judge in the district approved the search warrant for the Alexandria, Virginia home of former Trump campaign manager  Manafort in July. A grand jury in the district earlier this year became part of Mueller’s probe of former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who is under scrutiny for his work as a lobbyist for a Turkish businessman.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (Reuters) - The Kentucky county clerk who drew worldwide attention for her refusal to issue marriage licenses to gay couples two years ago will run for re-election next year, her attorney said on Tuesday. Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will run to retain her seat in 2018 despite suggestions from some people that she run for a higher local or statewide political position, said Mat Staver, founder of Liberty Counsel.  Davis spent five days in jail in September 2015 after refusing a court order to issue marriage licenses following the Supreme Court’s decision legalizing same-sex marriage. Davis claimed same-sex marriage went against her Apostolic Christian beliefs. Staver’s organization represented Davis in the resulting lawsuit filed by four couples against her. “She’s not interested in any other office,” Staver said. Last month, Davis and a representative of Liberty Counsel traveled to Romania, where those against same-sex marriage seek a referendum on the issue this fall, to meet with religious and political leaders, Staver said.     Davis’ case in 2015 drew hundreds of protesters and supporters to her office in Morehead, in rural eastern Kentucky. While she was in jail, then-Republican presidential candidates Mike Huckabee and Ted Cruz visited her.  Less than a month after she was released from jail, Davis, who won election to the office in 2014 as a Democrat, changed her affiliation to the Republican Party.        Rowan County Democratic party officials could not be reached for comment. Prior to her election, Davis served as a deputy to her mother, Jean Bailey, who served as the county clerk for nearly four decades.

Among the signers were former Homeland Security (DHS) secretaries Tom Ridge and Michael Chertoff, both Republicans who served under former President George W. Bush.  “Ms. Nielson has been engaged in counter-terrorism, all-hazard risk mitigation, critical infrastructure protection, and response policy from the earliest days of what we now know as homeland security,” the two former secretaries wrote in a latter viewed by Reuters.  A separate letter was signed by former National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander and former DHS officials Charles E. Allen, James M. Loy and John McLaughlin. The letter was also signed by Jane Holl Lute and Alejandro Mayorkas, both who served as under secretaries of DHS under former President Barack Obama. If confirmed by the Senate, Nielsen would take the reins at a sprawling department with more than 240,000 employees that is responsible for U.S. border and airport security, immigration policy, disaster response, refugee admissions and other matters. Nielsen, 45, is a cyber security expert with a considerable resume in homeland security work that includes service at the department’s Transportation Security Administration and on former Republican President George W. Bush’s White House Homeland Security Council. She was nominated to the role after John Kelly, the previous secretary, was named White House chief of staff this summer. Nielson worked as Kelly’s deputy in the White House prior to being nominated in October. ",Former U.S. Homeland Security officials back nominee ahead of hearing

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The National Football League said on Tuesday it opposes a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans that could force teams to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction. Under the legislation unveiled last week, local governments could no longer fund the building or renovation of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax-exempt, public-purpose bonds, the sort of bonds typically used to fund schools, libraries and public transit. According to the NFL, building new stadiums enhances economic development in cities that are home to the venues and federal tax breaks should be available. “You can look around the country and see the economic development that’s generated from some of these stadiums,” NFL spokesman Joe Lockhart told a conference call. “These sorts of infrastructure projects have a long history and the benefits of them are obvious in many of our communities around the country, so we will continue to make our opposition known on that.” President Donald Trump has called for an end to the subsidy, at least for the NFL, after some of its players angered the Republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in 2015. A report last year by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based social sciences research group, found that of the 45 major-league stadiums built or overhauled since 2000, 36 were at least partly funded by tax-exempt municipal bonds. The NFL’s Oakland Raiders are expected to begin playing in Las Vegas in 2020 and construction on a new stadium is already underway. Lockhart refused to what, if any, impact the bill could have on the viability of the new stadium. “That is a hypothetical at this point and we’d have to see how the final bill comes out,” he said. “What gets proposed out of the writing committee from the party in control very often is not what is eventually signed into law, so we’ll have to see where that goes.”             ",NFL opposes U.S. Republican tax plan on stadium funding
0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top Democrat on a House of Representatives committee  accused its Republican leaders of launching a spurious  investigation of Hillary Clinton to divert attention from inquiries on alleged links between Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia. Representative Elijah Cummings, the senior Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, on Tuesday wrote to the panel’s chairman, Trey Gowdy, complaining that Republicans had “rushed to launch” an investigation of a purported scandal involving Clinton and Robert Mueller, the special counsel who is investigating allegations about Trump campaign contacts with Russia. “With no consultation with Democrats, you and other Republicans rushed to launch your latest investigation of Secretary Clinton and Mr. Mueller directly after President Trump initiated his own Twitter campaign just days earlier to distract from the ongoing Russia investigations,” Cummings wrote. “This investigation is not - nor will it ever be - about one individual,” Gowdy said in response to a query. “It is about whether or not all pertinent information was known and shared with CFIUS at the time they made their decision and whether the actions of Russia in 2015 and 2016 should cause the U.S. to re-evaluate Russia’s motives in 2010,” he added, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. Cummings said Ron DeSantis, the Republican who chairs the oversight committee’s National Security Subcommittee, claimed he interviewed a confidential informant who had helped the FBI uncover a “scheme” to “bribe” then-Secretary of State Clinton to get the interagency committee to approve the sale of a Canadian uranium company to Russia. However, Clinton did not represent the State Department on the foreign investment committee, which approved the sale. Moreover, the major donor to her husband’s Clinton Foundation had sold his stake in Uranium One more than a year before Clinton became secretary of state and three years before Russia’s Rosatom bought the Canadian firm. Cummings said five congressional committees, including the House oversight committee, have investigated the deal and have  “identified no evidence to substantiate allegations that Secretary Clinton orchestrated, manipulated, or otherwise coerced” the interagency committee to approve the deal.     Several Republican members of Congress and some pro-Trump media organizations have demanded that Mueller resign, apparently because he was FBI director when the sale of the uranium company was approved.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House Judiciary Committee about issues facing the Justice Department on Nov. 14, the committee confirmed on Tuesday. The hearing will take place at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT), it said in a statement.  Reuters reported on Monday that the committee would hold a hearing with Sessions next week. It will offer Democrats their first opportunity to question him about his past statements regarding contacts between President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign and Russian intermediaries. In a letter to Sessions on Tuesday, all 17 Democratic members of the Judiciary Committee told the attorney general they would question him about his past denials of communications between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. Court filings made by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s role in the election, indicate that Trump foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos made Sessions aware of his contacts with Russian representatives. “When you appear before our Committee, we intend to ask you about these inconsistencies. We are providing you with notice in advance because we expect you to respond,” ranking committee Democrat Rep. John Conyers and his colleagues wrote Sessions. Separately, although some congressional aides had expected Sessions to also appear in a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 14, a Justice Department spokesman said there are no plans for him to do so.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SEOUL (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will wrap up his visit to Seoul on Wednesday with a major speech on North Korea and then shift focus to China, where he is expected to press a reluctant President Xi Jinping to tighten the screws further on Pyongyang,  U.S. officials say. Trump’s address to South Korea’s National Assembly will come a day after he seemed to take a more balanced approach: threatening to use America’s full military might against North Korea if needed, but also offering it a diplomatic opening to “make a deal” to end the nuclear standoff. While Trump presented no specific solution to his toughest global security challenge, his more conciliatory rhetoric toward North Korea could help lower tensions between Washington and Pyongyang that have put much of the east Asian region on edge over the prospects for military conflict. It contrasted markedly with Trump’s earlier threats to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States, and the personal insults he exchanged with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. It remains to be seen, however, whether the unpredictable Trump, in his final day on North Korea’s doorstep, will build  on this approach or return to the bellicose language that has characterized his handling of the North Korean issue. Trump’s official “talking points” for his Asia tour show that he intends to use the speech in part to contrast South Korea’s “amazing rise” with North Korea’s “sad, backward  state” and to urge resolve against Pyongyang, according to a confidential document reviewed by Reuters. He is also expected to condemn Pyongyang for its poor human rights record. Trump will then fly to Beijing where, according to senior administration officials, he will try to convince Xi to squeeze North Korea further with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. Previewing his Beijing visit, Trump told a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday that China and North Korea’s other giant neighbor, Russia, were among countries whose cooperation will be  crucial in getting North Korea to rein in its nuclear and missile programs. “President Xi … has been very helpful. We’ll find out how helpful soon,” Trump said. But it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree to do more. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated by the West, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is doing all it can to curtail the isolated nation’s nuclear and missile tests. “On this issue, China’s position and stance is already very clear and staunch,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Monday. “Everyone can see clearly that we don’t need anybody to tell us what we should be doing.” But with Trump appearing to crack open the  door to diplomacy with North Korea – something that China has long urged – he may have a better chance of securing further promises to intensify economic pressure on North Korea, which relies on Beijing for more than 90 percent of its trade. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, however, has seemed willing to risk snubbing China when he deems it useful as he pursues development of a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. At the same time, Xi may be mindful that Trump has held off on trade actions against China that he loudly threatened during the 2016 presidential campaign to give Beijing more time to make progress on North Korea. For his part, Xi will also be looking to maintain the good personal chemistry the two leaders developed when Trump hosted him at the Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in April. The “bromance” is set to continue when Xi returns the favor by laying on a lavish welcome for Trump’s visit starting on Wednesday. Trump is expected to go to the Forbidden City, possibly guided by Xi, and participate in an inspection of Chinese troops, though China has released few other details.

0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - During the eight years of the Obama administration, business lobbyists often found the gates to the White House closed tight.  They are open now under President Donald Trump. That is not altogether unexpected as the New York real estate developer did campaign during the 2016 presidential election on a promise to elevate the needs of business, which he argued would fuel economic growth.  What does surprise lobbyists, however, is the sheer number of wins in getting the Trump administration to roll back or delay unfavorable regulations in its first 10 months. And it is occurring despite White House dysfunction and distraction.  The lobbyists say it is a stark departure from the approach of the Obama administration, which had a reputation for aloofness toward business and sought to limit the influence of lobbyists, whom it saw as beholden to special interests. The Trump White House is listening to them, they say. It is returning their phone calls. And it is working to eliminate regulations they view as detrimental to the ability to prosper.  When 15 lobbyists and business leaders recently held talks with Trump administration officials on energy infrastructure and climate change, they were surprised by the officials' opening question: ""Do you have a regulation that we could put on a list to try to eliminate? Is there something that is impeding you from growing?""  In that moment, one of the lobbyists at the meeting knew it was a new era. “That as an opening was not the way the Obama administration approached meetings,” she said.  “It’s night and day,” between the Trump and Obama administrations, said James Thurber, a professor in the public affairs school at American University, who studies lobbying and its effects.  Trump promised to “drain the swamp,” an oath that came with plans to curb lobbying and end a “culture of corruption.” The campaign stump speech line had a populist appeal, but one person’s swamp dweller is another’s job creator.  Some of the 16 lobbyists spanning nine different industries interviewed by Reuters acknowledged that many people view them as part of the problem in Washington, not the solution, and that their growing influence may be seen by those as a negative.  Spending so far this year on lobbyists is on pace to exceed spending in 2016, according to the OpenSecrets website, with $2.43 billion spent over the first nine months compared to $2.38 billion at the same point in 2016.  After taking office in January, Trump quickly made it easier to get into the White House.  He reversed President Barack Obama’s restrictions that sought to keep lobbyists at bay by physically barring many of them from the White House - a rule that critics said did nothing more than move meetings with lobbyists to coffee shops across the street. And Trump has stopped the public disclosure of White House visitors’ logs, so now lobbyists come and go with less concern that their presence at the White House will be scrutinized.  Most lobbyists refused to speak on the record because they did not want to reveal anything about their private discussions with the administration. Lobbyists are also acutely aware that anything they say will be used by critics who think Trump has tilted too much toward corporate interests.  The White House did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article.  The coal, steel, oil and gas industries are some of the clear winners, with easier access to the Trump administration and more deregulation of their industries, said Stan Veuger, a fellow at the conservative thinktank American Enterprise Institute who studies politics and the economy.  That business has been given more access and even more control of certain regulatory issues is “fair criticism and praise if you want to call it that,” said Veuger.   There are big losers, too. Consumer advocacy and environmental groups warning about the perils of climate change, who enjoyed easy access to the Obama White House, have largely been shut out of a Trump White House that is more skeptical of climate change and believes Obama over-reached with some of his measures to protect consumers.  It was no secret that Trump wanted to greenlight the Dakota Access Pipeline to move oil from North Dakota to Illinois despite the fierce opposition of environmentalists and American Indian tribes whose land was being used. He spoke about it frequently during the campaign. Then Trump gave the energy industry more than they had hoped for.  The American Petroleum Institute, which represents all the large refiners, had asked the administration to speed the permitting process for drilling and building new facilities. When Trump signed his executive order authorizing the pipeline only four days after taking office, he also granted this wish.  A number of business trade groups asked the Trump administration to suspend a rule, created during the Obama years, that would require companies to disclose to the government any communications they have with employees during union disputes. In June, the Trump Labor Department did just that, citing the opposition from business.  Among the other wins for business, the Labor Department delivered on a top priority of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobbying group and Wall Street brokerages when it reversed an Obama-era rule aimed at brokers who recommend inappropriate retirement investments.  The administration also side-stepped the process to repeal regulations by implementing delays and holds on rules.  For instance, in the final months of the Obama administration the Bureau of Land Management created a rule governing methane and waste prevention over the strong objections of groups representing oil and gas companies.  API wrote to Ryan Zinke, Trump’s secretary of the interior, in May asking him to postpone implementation of the rule. The Trump administration announced it would and even cited the lobbyists’ objections as the reason.  Of course, it is not perfect harmony between Trump and business. Dozens of corporate leaders abandoned advisory business councils set up by Trump after he appeared to side with white supremacists following a white nationalist rally in Virginia that resulted in the death of a protester.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has spent the past few weeks ringing alarm bells over Trump’s various positions on the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement.  And yet, said Neil Bradley, one of the top lobbyists for the chamber, “I have even found in times when we may not see eye to eye with the administration on something, we have cordial, timely discussions that are substantive.”  ",'Open Sesame:' Lobbyists cheer warmer welcome in Trump White House
0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups will exercise together in the Western Pacific in the coming days in a rare show of force as President Donald Trump visits Asia with warnings about the nuclear threat from North Korea, U.S. officials say. The drill will include the USS Nimitz, the Ronald Reagan, the Theodore Roosevelt and their accompanying warships, the first time three U.S. aircraft carrier strike groups have exercised together in the region in a decade. A Japanese destroyer, the Inazuma, will join the armada, two Japanese government officials said, following a separate three-day exercise with the Reagan and two Indian warships in the Sea of Japan that ended Monday.    U.S. officials have previously said the drill was under consideration and that planning was under way. The decision to soon go forward with the exercise in the Western Pacific has not been previously published. The four U.S. officials and two Japanese sources who discussed the drill with Reuters spoke on condition of anonymity, and did not disclose the precise date or location of the exercise. The Pentagon and the Navy’s Pacific Fleet declined comment on future operations. Reuters was not aware of any plans for Trump to visit the carriers. Trump has reiterated his tough rhetoric against North Korea over its nuclear and missile programs since starting a 12-day trip to Asia on Sunday. Speaking in Tokyo on Monday, Trump renewed his warning that the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over. The U.S. leader, who began a visit South Korea on Tuesday, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if necessary to defend the United States or its allies, and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission. Kim has called Trump a “mentally deranged U.S. dotard.” The last time three U.S. carrier strike groups exercised together was in 2007, when the Nimitz, along with the John C. Stennis and Kitty Hawk carrier strike groups participated in drills near Guam. Such large-scale drills serve as a potent reminder of the U.S. ability to rapidly mobilize military force, a capability  the Trump administration has been keen to emphasize as Pyongyang races ahead with tests to build a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the United States. Since taking office, Trump has vowed to expand the fleet of U.S. carriers, even as some military strategists and experts believe the massive ships would be increasingly vulnerable to modern Chinese and Russian weapons in any conflict. Singapore-based military expert Tim Huxley said the presence of the U.S. carriers still sent an unmistakable message, with each one carrying 70-odd aircraft.   “Beyond the capability to project military power at great range, their ability to project political and psychological power is arguably unmatched, and we are seeing that play out,” said Huxley, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies. “While in a war against China, U.S. carriers might be vulnerable, they wouldn’t be in any conflict against North Korea...and three U.S. carriers can deliver a tremendous amount of airpower.” Carrier commanders say the strike groups are kept combat ready at all times, with jet fighters and surveillance planes flying constantly from their flight decks to maintain a protective screen. U.S. defense officials noted recently the presence of the three U.S. carriers in the region was reassuring allies, even though it was long scheduled. “It does demonstrate a capability that no other nation in the world can do,” Joint Staff Director Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie Jr said earlier this month. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called for restraint during a regular news briefing on Tuesday when asked about the carriers, saying the situation on the Korean peninsula was complex and severe. “All relevant sides should exercise restraint, avoid irritating each other, dedicate themselves to lowering the tense situation on the peninsula, and at the same time make positive efforts to get the North Korean nuclear issue back on a track to a resolution via talks as soon as possible,” Hua said, reiterating the long-held Chinese position. The CIA has said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, on a trip late last month to South Korea, was at pains to stress that diplomacy was America’s preferred course to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. Still, he warned Pyongyang that its military was no match for the U.S.-South Korean alliance, and that diplomacy was most effective “when backed by credible military force.” ",U.S. to stage drill with three carriers as Trump visits Asia
0,True,"November 7, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to President Donald Trump, testified to U.S. lawmakers that he met with a Russian deputy prime minister on two trips to Moscow in 2016 and consulted with senior Trump campaign staff about one visit. In testimony made public on Monday, Page initially said he did not meet with any senior Russian officials during a trip in July 2016 but later said he “briefly” greeted Russian deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich, and saw him again at a dinner in December 2016. When asked if he had a private meeting with Dvorkovich on that second trip, Page replied: “We did - he stopped by a dinner I went to in December with people from the university.” Page also said he let senior members of Trump’s campaign staff know of his trip in July 2016, including then-Republican Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now U.S. attorney general, as well as senior Trump aides Hope Hicks and Corey Lewandowski. Page said he reported back to other campaign officials about the July 2016 trip, saying in one email that he had received “incredible insights and outreach”.  He has for months said the trip was made as a private citizen, not as part of his role with the Trump campaign.  Page was interviewed for seven hours last Thursday by members of the House of Representatives’ Intelligence committee, which is probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible collusion by Trump campaign officials. Special prosecutor Robert Mueller is leading a criminal investigation into the same issues and last week charged two former Trump campaign advisers, Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes. Page, a former Merrill Lynch investment banker in Moscow, has attracted the scrutiny of investigators for his numerous contacts with Russia. His trip to Moscow in July 2016 came after he joined the  Trump campaign and he used it to deliver a pro-Russia speech at a university.  But Page, who declined to have an attorney present during the testimony to the House committee, said his trips to Russia were “benign” and blasted the congressional investigations as a waste of time and money.  Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House’s Intelligence committee, said Page’s testimony showed that his denials of formal meetings with senior Russian officials were inaccurate.  “Perhaps most important, Page — after being presented with an email he sent to his campaign supervisors, and which he did not disclose to the Committee prior to the interview and despite a subpoena from the Committee — detailed his meetings with Russian government officials and others, and said that they provided him with insights and outreach that he was interested in sharing with the campaign,” Schiff said. In his testimony, Page said he has been interviewed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation about Russia and the election four or five times this year. When asked if he had been contacted by Mueller, he said he would rather not discuss it.  ",Former Trump adviser Page met Russian officials in 2016 Moscow trips
0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican lawmakers on Monday began revising their proposed overhaul of the U.S. tax code, as Democrats pointed to the loss of popular deductions as proof the legislation was an assault on the middle class. A draft bill unveiled last week by Republicans in the House of Representatives, if enacted, would be the biggest restructuring of the tax system since the 1980s and the first major legislative victory of the Trump presidency. One of the first changes agreed to on Monday, related to carried interest, would go toward fulfilling one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises.  Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House tax-writing panel, offered to make smaller portions of Wall Street financiers’ income eligible for a lower capital gains tax rate.  It was one of many revisions that are expected as the House Ways and Means Committee amends the tax bill. Brady pledged to lawmakers that they would have a chance to propose their own changes. “Let me assure you this is the beginning of the tax reform process,” he told the committee. Although Republicans generally support the bill’s broader themes, including a sharp cut in the corporate income tax, there are rumblings of dissent over other elements, including repeal of the deduction for state and local income tax (SALT) payments. New York, California and other high-tax states would be hard hit by the removal of that deduction, a fact seized upon by Democrats to bolster their argument that Trump’s plan is a gift to the wealthiest Americans and the corporate sector. “There are a lot of people expecting a tax cut who will be big losers under this bill,” Representative Bill Pascrell of New Jersey, a Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee, said as the tax-writing panel convened to consider the bill. An analysis of how taxpayers would be impacted by the bill from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center issued on Monday was later withdrawn due to an error. TPC said that its analysis contained an error related to a proposed child tax credit and that it would release a revised version as soon as possible. The White House argues that tax cuts are needed to boost economic growth and create jobs.   The linchpin of the plan is the reduction of the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and establishment of a 25 percent tax rate for “pass through” businesses, which currently pay income tax rates as high as 39.6 percent. With Democrats united in opposition to the plan, Republican defections from a few traditionally Democratic-leaning states could be enough to torpedo it in the House.   Brady has already agreed to retain the deduction for property tax payments up to a cap of $10,000 as part of a SALT compromise and has said he would be open to raising it. Brady’s carried interest provision would lengthen to more than three years from one the amount of time Wall Street financiers must hold assets in order to be eligible for a lower tax rate. Carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits – typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors – that goes to the general partners of private equity, venture capital and hedge funds. Under current law, high-income fund partners pay the long-term capital gains rate of 20 percent on their carried interest income, instead of the 39.6 percent individual tax rate that applies to the ordinary wage income of high earners.   Securing congressional passage of the tax plan is critically important to Trump, who has yet to get major legislation through Congress since taking office in January, including a healthcare overhaul he promised as a candidate last year. Investors are adding to the pressure. The expectation of deep tax cuts has helped fuel a stock market rally during Trump's time as president, with the broad S&P 500 index .SPX up about 14 percent. The Senate, where Republicans have a 52-48 majority, is developing its own version of the tax legislation, which would have to eventually be reconciled with the House version before it is sent to Trump for signing. Several Republican senators have said they would have a problem voting for any tax bill that significantly increased the deficit. The House bill is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion national debt. Fitch Ratings said on Monday that the House bill could add to the fiscal strain in some states and local jurisdictions by limiting their tax-raising flexibility. Republican leaders are pushing for the House to vote on a revised tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. They have said a draft Senate bill could be ready at the end of this week. The Republican tax plan was devised without Democratic input. The last major tax restructuring, Republican former President Ronald Reagan’s 1986 overhaul, received significant input and support from Democrats.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said on Monday he probably would not keep his holdings in a shipping company with business ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin’s inner circle and that he had fully and properly disclosed investments. Pressed on whether he would retain the interest in Navigator Holdings, Ross told Bloomberg Television: “I’ve been actually selling it anyway, but that isn’t because of this.” Ross, a billionaire investor who is helping to shape Republican President Donald Trump’s trade policy, was criticized when several media outlets reported that he had failed to disclose that one of Navigator’s clients is Russian gas and petrochemical company Sibur. Sibur’s owners include Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov, and Gennady Timchenko, a Putin associate who is subject to U.S. Treasury sanctions. The information is based on leaked documents from offshore law firm Appleby that are part of the so-called Paradise Papers, which show details of business dealings by wealthy people and institutions ranging from Ross to Britain’s Queen Elizabeth and trading firm Glencore (GLEN.L). They were obtained by Germany’s Sueddeutsche Zeitung newspaper and shared with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and some media outlets and published on Sunday. Reuters has not independently verified the documents. The Paradise Papers are the second release of its kind by the ICIJ, which last year published the “Panama Papers,” leaked documents from Panama law firm Mossack Fonseca that chronicled a shadowy world of offshore holdings and hidden wealth. Ross said in multiple media interviews that he had fully disclosed his stake in Navigator Holdings as part of government ethics requirements. “There was disclosure, there is no impropriety and if people draw a contrary conclusion that’s because the papers have twisted the story and made it into something that it’s not there,” Ross told the BBC. U.S. media said partnerships used by Ross have a 31 percent stake in Navigator Holdings, which was included in Ross’ 57-page public financial disclosure report filed in December, before he officially joined the Trump administration. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat on the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, said Ross had deceived the public as well as lawmakers who had confirmed his appointment to Trump’s Cabinet after he promised to divest holdings that posed conflicts. Blumenthal called for an investigation and hearings. “If he fails to present a clear and compelling explanation, he ought to resign,” Blumenthal told MSNBC. Senate Commerce Committee spokesman Frederick Hill said that Ross’ interest in Navigator was disclosed to the panel, but added: “The committee expects Secretary Ross will follow the advice of his department’s ethics officials should there be a determination that any holding creates a conflict of interest.” Navigator did not come up at Ross’ confirmation hearing in January, but he was asked about his decision to retain an interest in Diamond S Shipping, which operates 33 petroleum product tankers. Ross said his research showed that no ocean shipping cases had ever come before the Commerce Department. Ocean shipping is regulated by the Federal Maritime Commission, an independent agency. But asked by Democratic Senator Maria Cantwell if he would look at additional areas for possible further recusals from potential conflicts of interest, Ross replied: “I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal in any topic where there is the slightest scintilla of a doubt.” Scrutiny of any ties between Russia and Trump administration officials has intensified with investigations into allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election campaign and potential collusion by the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has denied such meddling and Trump has denied any collusion.  Officials from Navigator could not be reached for comment. Appleby released a statement late on Sunday saying that the release of its documents was the result of “an illegal computer hack” and not a leak. “This was not the work of anybody who works at Appleby,” the firm with offices in Bermuda, the Cayman Islands, Hong Kong and other offshore jurisdictions said.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions is due to testify before a congressional committee next week, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday, offering Democrats a chance to question him about his past statements on President Donald Trump’s campaign exchanges with Russian intermediaries. Sessions’ testimony before the House Judiciary Committee, which has not been publicly announced, was confirmed by a Justice Department spokesman and two congressional aides. The open hearing, tentatively scheduled for Nov. 14, is part of the committee’s regular oversight of the Justice Department, but Russia appears almost certain to be a topic. Separately, Sessions is due to appear in a closed session before the House Intelligence Committee on Nov. 14, a source familiar with that panel’s plans said.  Senate Democrats last week demanded that Sessions be recalled to testify on the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts after the disclosure of an effort to set up a meeting between then-Republican candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. That, they said, conflicted with Sessions’ earlier statements to Congress. The effort to set up a Trump-Putin meeting - which never took place - was disclosed in court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russia’s role in the 2016 presidential election and whether there was collusion between Trump aides and the Kremlin. According to the documents, George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, said at a March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump foreign policy advisers “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.” Both Sessions and Trump attended that meeting, according to a photo posted on Trump’s Instagram account. Democrats want to question Sessions because, in October, he told the Senate Judiciary Committee that a continuing exchange between the Trump campaign and Russian government intermediaries “did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.” Sessions has denied misleading congressional committees about his interactions regarding Russia. He had to recuse himself from investigations into the alleged Russian interference after it was revealed in March that he met with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at least twice in 2016. J.D. Gordon, a former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser who was at the March 2016 meeting, told Reuters that Papadopoulos indeed “made a pitch for meeting with Putin.” But Sessions shot the idea down, Gordon said. “Yes, within minutes. He was quite clear. We thought that was the end of it.” Papadopoulos continued trying to arrange contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia, the court filings say.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. district judge again declined to ease bail conditions for President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his business associate Richard Gates on Monday, saying they still needed to provide more financial information. Judge Amy Berman Jackson said she was concerned about some of the $12 million in assets that Manafort had offered as security to get the court to lift house arrest and allow him to stop wearing an electronic monitoring device. Manafort and Gates have pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment as part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential collusion with Trump associates. They are charged with conspiring to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. Jackson said she was especially worried about life insurance policies Manafort had offered as part of an effort to secure better bail conditions. The policies, valued at about $4.5 million are held in trust and in his wife’s name. But having a relative serving as a surety, or a guarantor of the policy, Jackson said, “is very problematic.” Anyone serving in this capacity needs to provide details about their assets and liabilities, she said.     Life insurance policies held in trust tend to have many restrictions and can also be subject to asset forfeiture in the case of a conviction, the judge said. “A lot of these details need to be nailed down” she said. Prosecutors also say they are not yet satisfied they have enough details on how to value Manafort’s properties, including a condo he has in Trump Tower, the president’s signature building in New York. Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling in the election. Trump has denied collusion between his associates and Russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt. The judge last week also denied requests from Manafort and Gates for an easing of their bail conditions. Jackson did grant a request from Gates to be allowed to leave his Virginia home on Tuesday to vote. On Monday, the judge said she is not very likely to grant any requests for the freedom to travel internationally and is inclined to require the pair to stay in the Washington area for work, unless such trips are cleared in advance. Currently, Manafort has promised to pay $10 million and Gates $5 million if they fail to appear for future court appearances. Manafort is seeking permission to travel to New York where he has clients, as well as Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where his attorney Kevin Downing said he has a telecommunications business involving secure and “virtually indestructible” cell phones.  A spokesman for Manafort could not immediately provide details on the business when asked by Reuters on Monday. The judge also held off on setting a future trial date, and ordered the parties to return for a status hearing on Dec. 11. ",U.S. judge keeps bail conditions for ex-Trump campaign aide Manafort
0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump asked Congress on Monday for $4 billion to support missile defense to counter the threat from North Korea, just ahead of his first visit to South Korea since taking office in January. “This request supports additional efforts to detect, defeat, and defend against any North Korean use of ballistic missiles against the United States, its deployed forces, allies, or partners,” Trump wrote in a letter to Congress. Trump repeated his request that Congress provide $1.6 billion to build a wall on the U.S. border with Mexico. Trump’s plan to construct the wall was a centerpiece of his successful presidential campaign, but it has been questioned by some of his fellow Republicans, as well as most Democrats, in Congress. He made his request during his maiden trip to Asia as president, featuring repeated meetings with regional partners and others largely focused on how to address North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs. Trump had originally asked for $9.9 billion for the year ended Sept. 30, 2018, for missile defense, which some lawmakers had dismissed as too low. Trump’s request included $700,000 to repair damage to Navy ships after recent fatal collisions, and $1.2 billion for increased troop levels in Afghanistan and the administration’s South Asia strategy in his supplemental budget request. The budget request said the funds for South Asia would support the deployment of 3,500 more troops. The Republican leaders of the Senate and House of Representatives Armed Services Committees, Senator John McCain and Representative Mac Thornberry, said in a joint statement that they welcomed Trump’s request and looked forward “to giving it the serious consideration it deserves.” Members of the two committees are working on a final version of the annual National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, which sets out policy for the Pentagon. McCain and Thornberry said the submission of the budget amendment before that work was completed means that NDAA conferees will be able to consider whether to incorporate the additional funding into the final agreement. “This request also underscores the threat posed by the rogue North Korean regime and the urgent need to boost our missile defense capabilities to meet it,” McCain and Thornberry said in a statement. The $2.1 billion for missile defense makes up the bulk of the request. It would pay for 20 more missiles that could intercept incoming intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) launched from North Korea, a network of radars, and other equipment designed to protect the United States. Boeing Co (BA.N) is the prime contractor for the anti-ballistic missiles, known as Ground-Based Interceptors, and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) makes the missile’s “kill vehicle,” which pops off the top of the defending missile above the earth’s atmosphere and seeks out and destroys the attacking missile’s warhead. The request also includes money for 50 Lockheed Martin Corp-made (LMT.N) Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptors. The United States has THAAD interceptors in Guam that guard against any intermediate-range ballistic missile attacks from North Korea.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Two children, backed by the Clean Air Council environmental group, sued U.S. President Donald Trump and two of his Cabinet members on Monday to try to stop them from scrapping a package of pollution-reduction rules known as the Clean Power Plan. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, says the United States is “relying on junk science” and ignoring “clear and present dangers of climate change, knowingly increasing its resulting damages, death and destruction.”  It was the latest legal action that green advocates have taken to combat Trump administration efforts to roll back environmental regulations through rule changes at agencies like the U.S. Department of Interior and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The two young plaintiffs, aged 7 and 11, are identified only by their first and last initials in the court papers, which allege that both are suffering from the effects of a rapidly warming climate. Trump has called climate change a hoax and said in June he would withdraw the United States from a global pact to combat it - calling the deal’s demands for emissions cuts too costly for the U.S. economy. The lawsuit asks the court to prevent the EPA, Trump and the U.S. Department of Energy, along with Energy Secretary Rick Perry and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, from rolling back any rules that “increase the frequency and/or intensity of life-threatening effects of climate change.”  EPA and Energy Department representatives declined to comment. A White House spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  Pruitt said on Oct. 10 he wanted to scrap the Clean Power Plan, put in place under former Democratic President Barack Obama. On Sept. 29, Perry asked federal regulators to provide price incentives to help keep coal and nuclear power plants open, as a way to address “risks” to the resilience of the electrical grid. By including the children, the Clean Air Council seemed to model its case after Juliana v. U.S., a pending federal case in which a group of teenagers sued the U.S. government for violating their constitutional rights by causing climate change. “The Clean Air Council case is taking the legal theories pioneered in Juliana and applying them to a narrow set of facts related to specific rollbacks of the Trump administration,” said Meg Ward, a spokeswoman for Our Children’s Trust, a group leading the Juliana suit.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Monday that Japan would shoot North Korean missiles “out of the sky” if it bought the U.S. weaponry needed for doing so, suggesting Tokyo take a stance it has avoided until now. North Korea is pursuing nuclear weapons and missile programs in defiance of U.N. Security Council sanctions and has made no secret of its plans to develop a missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. It has fired two missiles over Japan. Trump, speaking after a summit with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, repeated his mantra the “era of strategic patience” with North Korea was over, and said the two countries were working to counter the “dangerous aggressions”. Trump also pressed Japan to lower its trade deficit with the United States and buy more U.S. military hardware. “He (Abe) will shoot them out of the sky when he completes the purchase of lots of additional military equipment from the United States,” Trump said, referring to the North Korean missiles. “The prime minister is going to be purchasing massive amounts of military equipment, as he should. And we make the best military equipment by far.” Abe, for his part, said Tokyo would shoot down missiles “if necessary”. Trump was replying to a question that was posed to Abe - namely how he would respond to a quote from Trump from a recent interview in which he said Japan was a “samurai” nation and should have shot down the North Korean missiles. Japan’s policy is that it would only shoot down a missile if it were falling on Japanese territory or if it were judged to pose an “existential threat” to Japan because it was aimed at a U.S. target. The U.S. president is on the second day of a 12-day Asian trip that is focusing on North Korea’s nuclear missile programs and trade. “Most importantly, we’re working to counter the dangerous aggressions of the regime in North Korea,” Trump said, calling  Pyongyang’s nuclear tests and recent launches of ballistic missiles over Japan “a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability”. “Some people said that my rhetoric is very strong. But look what’s happened with very weak rhetoric over the last 25 years. Look where we are right now,” he added. North Korea’s recent actions have raised the stakes in the most critical international challenge of Trump’s presidency. The U.S. leader, who will visit South Korea on the trip, has rattled some allies with his vow to “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatens the United States and with his dismissal of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as a “rocket man” on a suicide mission. Abe, with whom Trump has bonded through multiple summits and phone calls, repeated at the same news conference that Japan backed Trump’s stance that “all options” are on the table,  saying it was time to exert maximum pressure on North Korea and the two countries were “100 percent” together on the issue. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying, in  response to Abe’s comments, said that the North Korean “situation” was “already extremely complex, sensitive and weak”. “We hope that under the present circumstances, all sides’ words and actions can help reduce tensions and reestablish mutual trust and getting the North Korean nuclear issue back on the correct track of dialogue and negotiations,” she said. Trump said he was committed to achieving “free, fair, and reciprocal” trade and wants to work with Japan on this issue. “America is also committed to improving our economic relationship with Japan,” Trump said. “As president, I’m committed to achieving fair, free, and reciprocal trading relationship. We seek equal and reliable access for American exports to Japan’s markets in order to eliminate our chronic trade imbalances and deficits with Japan.” Earlier, speaking to Japanese and U.S. business executives, Trump praised Japan for buying U.S. military hardware. But he added that “many millions of cars are sold by Japan into the United States, whereas virtually no cars go from the United States into Japan”. Japan had a $69 billion trade surplus with the United States last year, according to the U.S. Treasury Department. The United States was Japan’s second biggest trade partner after China, while Japan was the United States’ fourth largest goods export market in 2016. Japanese officials have countered U.S. trade complaints by noting Tokyo accounts for a much smaller slice of the U.S. deficit than in the past, while China’s imbalance is bigger. In a second round of economic talks in Washington last month, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso, who doubles as deputy premier, failed to bridge differences on trade issues. The two sides are at odds over how to frame future trade talks, with Tokyo pushing back against U.S. calls to discuss a bilateral free trade agreement. Trump also said earlier that an Indo-Pacific trade framework would produce more in trade that the Trans-Pacific Partnership pact pushed by his predecessor but which he announced Washington would abandon soon after he took office. The 11 remaining nations in the TPP, to which Japan’s Abe is firmly committed, are edging closer to sealing a comprehensive free trade pact without the United States. Trump met Emperor Akihito, exchanging a handshake and nodding, before his lunch and talks with Abe. He also met relatives of Japanese citizens abducted by North Korean agents decades ago to help train spies, calling the kidnappings a “tremendous disgrace” and pledging to work with Abe to bring the victims “back to Japan where they want to be”. “I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back,” Trump said. “If he would send them back, that would be the start of something, something very special.”   Abe has made resolving the emotive abductions issue a keystone of his career. The families hope their talks with Trump - the third U.S. president they have met - will somehow contribute to a breakthrough, although experts say progress is unlikely. Abe also expressed his condolences for the victims of a gunman who massacred at least 26 worshippers at a church in Texas. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump had no plans to change the schedule for his 12-day Asian trip, which will also take him to Seoul, Beijing and Danang, Vietnam.

New York attorney Alan Futerfas, who represents Donald Trump Jr., did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A representative for the Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, did not answer calls seeking comment.  The June 2016 meeting in New York between Veselnitskaya and Donald Trump Jr, along with other senior Trump campaign officials, has become part of an investigation into allegations Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election. Trump has denied his campaign colluded with Moscow. Bloomberg quoted Veselnitskaya as saying in an interview in Moscow that she was lobbying against the so-called Magnitsky law, adopted by Washington in response to the 2009 death of Sergei Magnitsky, a whistle-blowing lawyer and auditor.  Supporters of Magnitsky say the Russian state murdered him by denying him adequate medical care while he was in prison on tax evasion charges. The Kremlin denies the allegation.  In the interview with Bloomberg, Veselnitskaya quoted Donald Trump Jr as saying during their meeting, in reference to the Magnitsky law: “Looking ahead, if we come to power, we can return to this issue and think what to do about it.” According to Bloomberg, Veselnitskaya also recalled the future president’s son as saying: “I understand our side may have messed up, but it’ll take a long time to get to the bottom of it.” Veselnitskaya said that at their meeting she offered to pass on information pertaining to alleged tax evasion by wealthy Democratic Party donors. She said Trump Jr. Had asked for documents proving the tax evasion, that she did not have any such documents and described the 20 minute meeting as a failure.

Sibur was commenting on reports that Ross has kept investments in Navigator Holdings, a shipping firm which has supplied services to Sibur. Stakeholders in Sibur include an associate of Russian Vladimir Putin who is subject to U.S. sanctions. In a statement, Sibur said that in the first half of this year, Sibur spent $15.9 million on services provided by Navigator, or 2.8 percent of Sibur’s overall expenditure on logistics. It said Navigator was never a sole contractor for shipping Sibur’s petrochemical products. “All negotiations and meetings were held solely by Sibur management and solely with management of those companies (which were shipping Sibur’s liquefied petroleum gas) and without shareholders’ involvement,” Sibur said in an emailed statement. “In connection with the introduction in 2014 of sanctions with regard to one of the company’s shareholders, our counter-parties conducted all necessary checks into whether there were any restrictions on working with Sibur. No such restrictions were found,” the statement said. “Sibur expresses its surprise at the politically-charged interpretation in certain media publications of regular commercial activities, over many years, which from the outset were reflected in the company’s published accounts.” Sibur’s shareholders include Gennady Timchenko, a close Putin ally who has been under U.S. sanctions since 2014. Another Sibur shareholder is Putin’s son-in-law, Kirill Shamalov. Shamalov did not reply to an email from Reuters seeking  comment.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s 90 percent cut to Obamacare advertising has U.S. health insurers in many states digging deeper into their pockets to get the word out about 2018 enrollment, which opened last week. Independence Blue Cross, a health insurer in Pennsylvania, has commissioned a tractor trailer truck to bring insurance consultants out to shopping centers and other neighborhood spots around Philadelphia.      Centene Corp (CNC.N), best known for its Medicaid health insurance, is expanding TV and print advertising for Obamacare as it ventures into three new states: Kansas, Missouri and Nevada. Tech-savvy newcomer Oscar Health has four different TV commercials running in six states including Texas and Ohio that espouse “easy health insurance” with video shots of patients text-messaging with Oscar.     Trump cut $90 million in advertising and outreach spending for the 2018 enrollment period, which opened on Nov. 1, part of his promise to let Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law “implode” until Congress can repeal it. Republicans say the Affordable Care Act, the law that created Obamacare, drives up costs for consumers, while Democrats warn that millions of Americans will be left without healthcare if it is dismantled. The advertising serves two roles: It helps draw in the young, healthy customers who keep overall member costs down and it addresses confusion among many people over whether the subsidies that help make coverage affordable to many and Obamacare itself still exist in the wake of Trump’s actions. The government’s advertising budget is now just $10 million for the 39 states that rely on the federal Healthcare.gov website to enroll consumers. The 11 states that run their own exchanges, like California and New York, set their own advertising budgets.      “Our member plans are generally ramping up their efforts to kind of plug that hole,” said Kelley Turek, an executive policy director at industry lobbyist America’s Health Insurance Plans. “A decrease of $90 million is a big hole to plug.” News headlines about changes in the government's support of Obamacare and Trump’s tweets have raised fears that all program subsidies are ending. The government has also cut the enrollment period in half, to six weeks. (tmsnrt.rs/2k1HAlV) Adding to the confusion, insurers like Anthem Inc (ANTM.N) have sharply raised monthly premiums on the most popular Obamacare plans to account for reduced government funding, or pulled out of dozens of U.S. counties. As a result, many Obamacare customers may need to change health plans for 2018, either to work with a different insurer or in response to price increases.     “I still run into people who are wondering, am I still going to have a plan next year?” Independence Blue Cross Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hilferty said in an interview.      Hilferty said the company is increasing its advertising this year in part because of that confusion. In September, the Congressional Budget Office said it expected 2018 enrollment to reach 11 million people versus about 10 million this year. It cut its previous projection by 4 million as Trump threatened the law and later cut the estimated $10 billion in government subsidies to insurers to cover customer out-of-pocket costs in 2018. To make up for the reduced subsidies, which apply to the most common “silver” plans - the middle tier of the plans offered - insurers raised premiums by about 20 percent on those plans.  Others say total sign-ups will drop. Get America Covered, an outreach group founded by former Obama administration officials, predicts 1.1 million fewer people will sign up during the enrollment period.    Lori Lodes, a co-founder of the group, said the effort by insurers focused on local markets could not match the impact of a national campaign.      Various insurers say they are trying. Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota, the sole Obamacare insurer in most of North Dakota, increased online advertising for 2018, while traditional TV and radio advertising remained about flat, spokeswoman Andrea Dinneen said. Florida Blue, which has about 1 million members in Obamacare plans throughout Florida, is increasing its grass roots efforts this year. It has hired 700 temporary employees to help with enrollment and is planning to take part in more than 1,000 enrollment events, such as county fairs or educational sessions, spokesman Paul Kluding said. On the other hand, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan said it would spend less on wooing customers because of the financial pressures from the lowered subsidies, which went into effect this month. Instead it will focus on helping existing customers select plans that may keep premium costs down, rather than automatically re-enrolling in the silver plans. “We decided to try to be as lean as possible,” said Rick Notter, director of the individual business.

He added that the senator’s type of injury could lead to life-threatening injuries. Paul, 54, also has lung contusions, Stafford said in the statement, according to the reports. The Bowling Green Daily News, citing an arrest warrant, said Paul told police his neighbor came on to his property in a gated community just east of Bowling Green and tackled him from behind. Paul had injuries to the face and trouble breathing because of a rib injury, the newspaper said. It was not clear what motivated the altercation and Paul did not go to the hospital, police said. Paul was mowing his lawn at the time of the attack, television station WAVE-TV in Kentucky reported. “Kelley and I appreciate the overwhelming support after Friday’s unfortunate event.

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Every American president has a favorite foreign leader. For Donald Trump, it seems to be Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The two leaders toasted their “bromance” on Monday as they wrapped up two days of golf, burgers and serious talks on trade and North Korea. The two men have met face-to-face six times since Trump was elected U.S. president a year ago and had 16 telephone conversations. They’ve played golf twice, once at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and again on Sunday outside Tokyo. Abe recalled how his grandfather, then-premier Nobusuke Kishi, and President Dwight D. Eisenhower began the tradition of U.S.-Japan golf diplomacy 60 years ago. “When you play golf not just once but two times, the person must be your favorite guy,” Abe said ahead of a formal banquet with Trump on Monday. He added that never had two Japanese and American leaders forged such a close bond in just one year. Abe was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election last November, a win that caught Tokyo off guard after many had expected Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton to win and worried about Trump’s “America First” rhetoric.  Trump told the dinner guests that for protocol reasons, he shouldn’t have met a foreign leader before his inauguration - but when he tried to call Abe to wave him off, the Japanese premier was already on a plane to New York. “We have to spend more time together because I enjoyed every minute of it even though he (Abe) is a very tough negotiator,” Trump said. “We will be back soon.”  Trump and Abe are hardly the only U.S. and Japanese leaders to bond. Ronald Reagan and Yasuhiro Nakasone set the gold-standard for friendly ties between leaders of the two allies back in the 1980s, when they famously called each other by the nicknames “Ron” and “Yasu”. George W. Bush and Junichiro Koizumi also bonded during Koizumi’s 2001-2006 term as Japanese premier, playing ball, eating BBQ at Bush’s Texas ranch, and visiting Elvis Presley’s Graceland mansion, where Koizumi crooned Elvis tunes.  Diplomatic experts said the personal chemistry between Abe and Trump appeared real, but also noted that forging warm ties were in a way a diplomatic necessity for Japan, which ultimately relies on the U.S. nuclear umbrella for its security.

Trump has incorporated into his attacks on Pyongyang the story of Megumi Yokota, 13 when she was snatched off a lonely beach by North Korean agents 40 years ago, mentioning her in a September speech at the United Nations. For his part, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has said he will not rest until the return of all 13 of those Pyongyang says were kidnapped in the 1970s and 1980s to train spies, making the issue a keystone of his political career. On Monday, Trump met Megumi’s mother Sakie, becoming the third president to do so, as well as the relatives of seven other abductees Pyongyang says are dead - like Megumi, who hanged herself, North Korea says. “We’ll work together and see if we can do something, now the spotlight is on,” Trump later told a joint news conference with Abe, calling the abductions a “very, very sad thing”. “Perhaps the regime itself would send them back. I think it would be a tremendous signal if Kim Jong Un would send them back.” Megumi’s mother and younger twin brothers were later part of a news conference that welcomed Trump’s attention, although cautiously, with several members saying decades had passed and nothing had been done, even by Abe’s government. “It seemed the president listened carefully to all our stories and was impressed,” said Koichiro Iizuka, an infant abandoned in a creche when his mother, Yaeko Taguchi, was abducted in 1978. “But if this is all that comes of this meeting, it’s absolutely outrageous,” he added. “It’s how we face the previous neglect and take action that’s important.” The families can do little, said Megumi’s mother, now 81 and visibly frail. “This is an issue of politics, of diplomacy,” she said. “All we can say is: please help them.” ","Families of Japanese abducted by North Korea meet Trump, but want action"

0,True,"November 6, 2017 ",politicsNews,"TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump greeted Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko on Monday with a genteel handshake and nod, but no bow, avoiding the pitfall of U.S. President Barack Obama who was criticized at home for his deep bow to the monarch. Trump, wearing a suit and tie and his wife, Melania, in a long, dark blue dress, were met at the palace entrance by the royal couple, who were both wearing suits. Trump smiled, shook hands and nodded at the 83-year-old emperor before greeting Michiko as well. The four entered the palace where they chatted through interpreters in footage aired live on television, but without sound as is customary. After the meeting, Trump shook hands again, and tapped the emperor’s arm repeatedly with his left hand. “Thank you for the great meeting”, he told Akihito. “I’m sure we will meet again”. Obama came under fire after meeting the emperor in Tokyo in 2009 for what his critics back home said was bowing too low to Akihito. Some U.S. commentators said the U.S. president should not lower his head before foreign monarchs. Akihito has spent much of his reign working to heal the wounds of World War II, which was waged across Asia in his father’s name, Emperor Hirohito. Obama also faced criticism from a different quarter - etiquette experts - who noted he combined a bow with an handshake, which is not done in Japan traditionally, whether meeting the emperor or anyone else. Japanese guests are not supposed to touch the royal couple or shake hands, but foreign guests often do. Hillary Clinton shook hands and air-kissed the empress on both cheeks, then took her hand as they entered the palace when she met the royal pair as secretary of state in 2011, a month or so after the triple disasters of an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown hit northeastern Japan in March of that year. Traditionalists say that Japan’s Chrysanthemum throne dates back more than 2,000 years. Akihito was the first royal heir in the Japanese imperial family to marry a commoner — a symbol of Japan’s new modernity and confidence. Japan earlier this year enacted a law clearing the way for Akihito, to step down, clearing the way for the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in nearly two centuries and the accession of his son, Crown Prince Naruhito in late 2018 early 2019. Akihito’s father, Emperor Hirohito, was considered divine until after Japan’s defeat in World War Two. The current emperor is defined by the constitution as a symbol of the people, and has no political authority although he is widely respected.

0,True,"November 5, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Sunday that Republican lawmakers are weighing a “host of ideas” as the House tax-writing committee begins revising a tax bill this week, though he expects the broad outlines to remain the same. Ryan, a Republican, told Fox News Sunday that House tax writers are considering President Donald Trump’s call to include in the tax package a repeal of an Affordable Care Act provision that mandates individuals buy insurance coverage. “We have an active conversation with our members and a whole host of ideas on things to add to this bill. And that’s one of the things that’s being discussed,” Ryan said. The tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee will on Monday begin considering revisions to the tax bill released last week, which would constitute the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s. Ryan said he believes the House is still on track to vote on a revised tax bill before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23.  The Senate is developing its own version of the legislation, but Ryan said he expected it to be similar enough that the two chambers could resolve their differences and pass a tax bill before year’s end. “We had basically decided the big ticket items: the big 20 percent corporate rate – a 25 percent rate for pass-through businesses, the middle class tax cut,” Ryan said.  “All of those things are things we agree on, and so these bills are written within those details.  So that’s why those differences will be fairly narrow,” he added.  If it passes, the tax overhaul will be the first major legislative achievement since Republicans took control of the White House and Congress in January - and a rebound from their failure to overturn the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare.  One sticking point among Republican lawmakers is the proposed repeal of a popular federal tax deduction for state and local tax (SALT) payments. The repeal would disproportionately hit taxpayers in states such as New Jersey, New York and California, which send enough Republican lawmakers to Congress to derail tax legislation. House Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady worked out a compromise last week that would preserve the deduction for property taxes, but not state and local income taxes. The property-tax deduction would be capped at $10,000, but Brady has already said he would be open to raising that cap. “It’s wrong and it would have an extremely damaging effect on my constituents,” Republican Representative Peter King of New York said on ABC’s This Week of the proposed state and local tax deduction repeal.  King said that Trump voters from his district in the suburbs of Long Island, near New York City, have contacted him to object to the proposal. His vote, he said, is a no “as of now.”  Representative Mark Meadows, the head of a conservative Republican faction in the House, indicated that he will support the tax package, even though estimates show it could add $1.5 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. “We believe that the economic growth will outweigh any short-term deficit increase that we see,” Meadows told ABC’s This Week. The House tax bill’s impact on the federal deficit, and its underlying assumptions about economic growth, have already prompted several Republican senators to say they could not support it.  Republicans hold 52 seats in the 100-seat Senate and can only afford to lose two votes to pass tax legislation with Vice President Mike Pence as a tie-breaker. “I am a no,” Republican Senator James Lankford told “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “I want to be sure we have reasonable assumptions in the process for growth estimates.” ","House weighing 'host of ideas' in tax bill revision, Ryan says"
0,True,"November 5, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special Counsel Robert Mueller pushed back on Sunday against Paul Manafort’s efforts to avoid house arrest, arguing that President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager needed to further detail the finances behind his proposed $12 million bail agreement. In a court memorandum, Mueller and his attorneys argued that the court should only agree to a bail agreement if Manafort fully explains his finances to the court. Prosecutors said his team had not been able to substantiate the value of one of the three properties, as well as several life insurance policies, Manafort wants to pledge for bail. Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates pleaded not guilty last week to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury. They face charges including conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The two are currently under house arrest, and prosecutors have argued they could pose a flight risk. The charges are part of Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by Trump associates, allegations that Moscow and the Republican president deny. In a Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on Fifth Avenue in New York that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in Trump Tower. But prosecutors said they needed an independent appraisal of that Fifth Avenue property, since Manafort was claiming a fair-market value of the unit that appeared to exceed other outside estimates. Prosecutors also argued they needed time to talk to Manafort’s insurance company about his policies. The prosecutors noted that Manafort would be required to forfeit one of those policies, worth $2.6 million, should he be convicted, creating additional questions about its value in a potential bail agreement. In the document, Mueller said his team was in talks with Manafort’s counsel about striking a bail agreement but that Manafort had not provided enough detail yet on his finances. “Those discussions are best described as ongoing, and the government is not prepared to consent to a change in the current conditions of release at least until Manafort provides a full accounting of his net worth and the value of the assets that he proposes to pledge,” Mueller said in the court memorandum. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes.

0,True,"November 5, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former head of the U.S. Democratic National Committee on Sunday defended her assertion that she had seriously considered proposing to replace Hillary Clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, and said her critics could “go to hell.” Donna Brazile has written in a soon-to-be-published book that she thought about working to replace Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after the nominee almost collapsed at an event on Sept. 11, 2016. In an interview on Sunday with ABC’s “This Week,” Brazile said she had supported Clinton but felt under pressure to come up with a “Plan B” after the candidate collapsed and many people were calling the DNC to ask about the incident. “I wanted her to win, but we were under pressure,” Brazile said. “For those who are telling me to shut up ... you know what I tell them? Go to hell. I’m going to tell my story.” Her book, “Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that put Donald Trump in the White House,” is set for release on Tuesday by Hachette Books. About 100 former Clinton campaign staffers have signed an open letter saying they were shocked to learn in Brazile’s upcoming book that she considered trying to replace both Clinton and Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016. She nearly fainted at a New York memorial ceremony for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. Her doctor said she had been diagnosed with pneumonia two days earlier, and she took several days off from campaigning. Brazile’s comments on ABC revealed tensions with Clinton’s  campaign staff. “I got sick and tired of people trying to tell me how to spend money,” she said. “ ... I wasn’t getting a salary. I was basically volunteering my time. “I’m not Patsey the slave,” Brazile said, referring to a character in the film “12 Years a Slave.” But Brazile said she had found no evidence that the Democratic primaries were rigged, a comment at odds with an article she wrote in Politico this week saying the process had been fixed in favor of Clinton, who had signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015. Leaked emails in 2016 suggested the party had favored Clinton over Sanders. Brazile replaced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz last year after a furor over the emails’ contents.

Rene Boucher, 59, of Bowling Green, Kentucky, was arrested and charged with one count of fourth-degree assault causing minor injury, the Kentucky State Police said in a statement on Saturday. Paul and Boucher were acquaintances, said Jeremy Hodges, a state police spokesman, who declined to say what led to the incident.  Paul’s office said in a statement the former Republican presidential candidate “was blindsided and the victim of an assault. The assailant was arrested, and it is now a matter for the police. Senator Paul is fine.” His office did not immediately respond to questions about the extent of any injuries the 54-year-old senator may have suffered or the circumstances of the incident. Hodges said Paul’s injuries were minor and did not require transport to a hospital. Boucher was booked into the Warren County Regional Jail. He was released on Saturday after posting a $7,500 bond, Captain Chip Olney of the facility said by phone. Boucher is scheduled to appear in court on Thursday, Olney said. It was unclear if Boucher has an attorney, and he could not be reached for comment late on Saturday. Paul, an ophthalmologist, dropped out of the race for president in February 2016 and successfully ran for re-election as a senator. In September, Paul opposed a partial repeal of healthcare reforms adopted under former Democratic President Barack Obama, angering President Donald Trump, a Republican.

0,True,"November 5, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - The Republican tax bill unveiled last week in the U.S. Congress could disrupt the global supply chains of large, multinational companies by slapping a 20-percent tax on cross-border transactions they routinely make between related business units.   European multinationals, some of which currently pay little U.S. tax on U.S. profits thanks to tax treaties and diversion of U.S. earnings to their home countries or other low-tax jurisdictions, could be especially hard hit if the proposed tax becomes law, according to some tax experts. Others said the proposal could run afoul of international tax treaties, the World Trade Organization and other global standards that forbid the double taxation of profits if the new tax did not account for income taxes paid in other countries. The proposed tax, tucked deep in the 429-page bill backed by President Donald Trump, caught corporate tax strategists by surprise and sent them scrambling to understand its dynamics and goals, as well as whether Congress is likely ever to vote on it. Reuters contacted seven multinational companies and four industry groups. None would comment directly on the proposal, with most saying they were still studying the entire tax package. The proposal is part of a broad tax reform bill unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans on Thursday, which promises to lower overall tax burdens and simplify the tax code. Whether the proposed reforms ever become law is uncertain, with weeks and possibly months of debate and intense lobbying still ahead. The House package overall has drawn criticism for adding too much to the federal budget deficit and too heavily favoring the rich and big business. However, the corporate tax part, experts said, included some ambitious proposals worthy of further discussion. They said the 20 percent excise tax is one such proposal targeting the abuses of so-called transfer-pricing where multinationals themselves set prices of goods, services and intellectual property rights that constantly move between their national business units. Under global standards, those prices should resemble those available on the open market. However, if a foreign parent charges U.S. affiliates inflated price, it can reduce its U.S. tax bill and effectively shift profits to a lower-tax country, reducing the entire corporation’s overall tax costs. “Clearly there’s a transfer-pricing issue and something should be done,” said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington think tank. “I would view this 20-percent excise tax as a blunt instrument to address the problem. And the problem with blunt instruments is sometimes they hit what you want to hit, and sometimes they hit what you don’t want to hit,” said Rosenthal, former legislation counsel at Congress’s Joint Tax Committee. Under the proposal, U.S. business units that import products, pay royalties or other tax-deductible, non-interest fees to foreign parents or affiliates in the course of doing business would either pay a 20-percent tax on these or agree to treat the amounts as income connected to their U.S. business and subject to U.S. taxes. As proposed, the new tax rule would apply only to businesses with payments from U.S. units to foreign affiliates exceeding $100 million. The rule would not take effect until after 2018. European companies that sell foreign-made products into the U.S. market through local distribution units could be among those most affected, said Michael Mundaca, co-director of the national tax department at the accounting firm Ernst & Young. Such companies could end up paying tax on the transfers twice - first if they paid the excise tax in the United States and then at home where they are taxed now and where the new U.S. tax would not be accounted for without changes to bilateral tax treaties. “That would be a structure that would at least initially be hit by the full force” of the excise tax, said Mundaca, a former U.S. Treasury Department assistant secretary for tax policy. He said European officials would be registering concern. “I am sure they are making calls right now to their counterparts in the U.S. Treasury looking for some explanation ... and making the point that this might be contrary to treaty obligations.” Gavin Ekins, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank, predicted that most multinationals would opt to avoid the excise tax by electing to pay U.S. corporate tax on all the profits related to products sold in the United States. Those include profits on activities conducted overseas, like manufacturing or research, which are also subject to foreign income taxes. The U.S. corporate tax rate on those profits would drop to 20 percent from 35 percent if the House bill becomes law. The promise of additional revenue and hopes that the new tax may entice multinationals to locate more production and jobs in the United States, may well outweigh international concerns. The entire Republican tax package is projected to add $1.5 trillion over 10 years to the $20 trillion federal debt and the planned excise tax is among sources of new revenue needed to avoid an even bigger shortfall. It is expected to bring about $155 billion over 10 years, according to a summary of the Republican proposal distributed last week. Still, as the tax debate heats up, foreign multinationals are likely to lobby hard against it, with domestic corporations linked to foreign affiliates possibly concerned as well. There is also uncertainty how the new rules would work in practice.  It was unclear, for example, from the bill’s language how companies should calculate income “effectively connected” to their U.S. business, Tax Foundation’s Ekins said. “You don’t know what profit is included when you choose ‘effectively connected income’ and don’t know the formula,” he said. “Is it just for that product line? All the income that comes in from every other company or from every other source?” The House tax committee was scheduled to begin considering amendments to the Republican tax bill on Monday.

0,True,"November 4, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump publicly appealed on Saturday for Saudi Arabia to list national oil company Saudi Aramco’s shares in New York, intervening in a battle among the world’s top stock exchanges.  “Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange,” Trump wrote on Twitter. “Important to the United States!” Trump did not say why he raised the issue at this time or whether he was responding to any information about the NYSE’s bid. But by describing the listing as a priority for Washington, he could help sway the Saudis’ decision. The Saudi government, seeking to raise money as low oil prices strain its finances, plans to sell about 5 percent of Aramco next year in a sale officials say could raise about $100 billion, making it the world’s largest initial public offer ever. Saudi authorities have said they intend to list Aramco in Riyadh and on one or more foreign exchanges, setting off a competition among New York, London, Hong Kong, Tokyo and other bourses. An Aramco spokesman had no comment on Trump’s tweet, while a spokeswoman for the NYSE declined to comment.  NYSE Group president Thomas Farley said at a conference in Riyadh last week that he had not given up on the IPO and was in talks with Saudi authorities. The London Stock Exchange has also received some government support for its bid, although that has been less public. Prime Minister Theresa May and the chief of the LSE pitched investments in Britain to the head of Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund on a visit to Riyadh earlier this year. While Trump’s tweet named the New York Stock Exchange, it did not mention rival Nasdaq Inc, which is also vying for the Aramco listing. “Generally, public servants should be impartial, not give preferential treatment to anyone, and avoid endorsements,” said  Scott Amey, general counsel for the government ethics watchdog Project on Government Oversight in Washington. “We have already seen violations in this administration, and it doesn’t help that the president isn’t leading by example.” Nasdaq replied to Trump in a tweet, saying it agreed the United States was the “best destination for global companies” but that Aramco belongs on Nasdaq “with the 5 most valuable operating companies in the world.”  Nearly two years after announcing their plan to sell Aramco shares, Saudi officials say they have not yet decided on foreign listing venues. Sources told Reuters in August that Riyadh favored New York for Aramco’s main foreign listing. But some financial and legal advisers have recommended London as a less problematic and risky option. Aramco’s lawyers warned about litigation risks associated with the U.S. Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, or JASTA. Passed last year, the law allows the Saudi government to be sued on the grounds that it helped to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, an allegation which Riyadh denies. Mohammed al-Sabban, who has been an adviser to former Saudi oil minister Ali al-Naimi, told Reuters that Trump’s intervention would not resolve the JASTA problem. “President Trump has forgotten completely that the risks of implementing the JASTA law against Saudi assets are still there,” Sabban said. “Probably during his administration he could prevent any case against Saudi Arabia. However, when President Trump’s term ends, this will raise fears that the JASTA law could still be applied.” Still, Trump may be able to wield diplomatic clout in Riyadh. Saudi leaders welcomed him warmly during a visit to the kingdom in May, partly because he has taken a tough stance against their nation’s diplomatic archrival Iran, and Riyadh is eager for close military ties with Washington. “President Trump’s tweet indicates that, from the White House’s perspective at least, a public listing of Aramco is not as dead as some recent reports indicated,” said Bob McNally, president of Washington-based energy market and policy consultant Rapidan Energy Group. “The tweet suggests the White House believes Saudi Arabia may be approaching a decision on where to list and wishes to either claim credit or push a possibly wavering Saudi Arabia for a New York listing,” McNally added.   Exchanges hosting Aramco can look forward to a boost in fee income from trading the stock. The prestige associated with the company may help them attract more big listings, including IPOs of other state companies from the Gulf as governments there sell assets in an era of cheap oil.

0,True,"November 5, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday vowed to ensure all candidates have an equal chance to win the Democratic presidential nomination after a former party chair accused the committee of rigging the process to aid Hillary Clinton in 2016. DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement the 2020 nominating process would be “unquestionably fair and transparent.” Perez made his comments after former DNC Chairwoman Donna Brazile said in an opinion piece in Politico earlier this week that the nomination process had been “rigged” in Clinton’s favor after she signed a fundraising agreement with the DNC in 2015. Clinton, a former U.S. senator and first lady, beat Senator Bernie Sanders for the nomination but lost the election to Republican Donald Trump in November 2016. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN this week that Perez needed to assure Democrats, including supporters of Sanders, that the process was fair and she agreed that the 2016 nominating process was “rigged.” Perez said he is “more committed than ever before to restoring voters’ faith in our democratic process because even the perception of impartiality or an unfair advantage undermines our ability to win. That is unacceptable.” Sanders’ campaign manager Jeff Weaver told CNN this week he thought the debate schedule was “rigged.” Perez said the party will “decide the debate schedule in advance, instead of negotiating it after all our candidates have entered the race” and “any and all joint fundraising agreements will be transparent.” Leaked emails in 2016 suggested the party had actively favored Clinton over Sanders. Former Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook on Friday denied the nomination had been rigged in Clinton’s favor. “Hillary Clinton won this primary with almost 4 million votes,” Mook told CNN. “The idea that the DNC could rig a contest frankly is laughable.” Brazile, who replaced former DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz last year after a furor over the contents of the leaked emails, also wrote she contemplated proposing to replace Clinton as the party’s 2016 presidential nominee, the Washington Post reported on Saturday. The Post said she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden after Clinton fainted in September 2016. In a soon-to-be published book, Brazile recounts deliberations as interim DNC chair whether to initiate the process of removing Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine, a Virginia senator, the Post reported, saying she ultimately did not seek to remove them. DNC rules give the party’s chair the ability to call a special meeting to consider replacing a nominee in the event of the death, resignation or disability after a candidate has officially been nominated, but only the full DNC has the power to fill vacancies.

0,True,"November 4, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort offered to post more than $12 million in real estate and life insurance assets and to limit his travel in a bid to avoid continued house arrest, according to court documents filed on Saturday. Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and associate Richard Gates earlier this week pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment by a federal grand jury.  The charges include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. They are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by Trump associates. In the Saturday court filing, Manafort offered to limit his travel to New York, Washington and Florida and pledged life insurance worth about $4.5 million as well as about $8 million in real estate assets, including a property on Fifth Avenue in New York that was identified by some media outlets as an apartment in Trump Tower. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said on Thursday that initial bail terms would remain in place and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes. On Friday, she suggested a potential May 7 trial date. Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, under unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively, which means they do not have to post the bail unless they fail to show up for court or violate other conditions. Prosecutors have argued there is a risk of flight and both men are subject to electronic monitoring. As part of the indictment, the special counsel’s office is seeking forfeiture of four of Manafort’s properties in connection with money laundering charges. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Saturday. Manafort, 68, in the filing also explained why he had three different U.S. passports, a fact noted by prosecutors. Manafort’s lawyer, Kevin Downing, rejected suggestions that Manafort was a “Jason Bourne character” - referencing a fictitious, globe-trotting, rogue covert agent. “The facts are much more mundane,” Downing wrote. Manafort had two passports, including one for submitting to foreign governments to receive visas while traveling on the other, his lawyers said. He was issued a third passport because one had been lost and Manafort contacted passport services to advise them it was found. Downing also wrote that funds Manafort had deposited in accounts on the island of Cyprus were legal and now had only “nominal” balances. Prosecutors said Manafort and Gates used numerous entities to transmit more than $18 million from Ukraine through Cyprus and eventually to the United States.  Federal prosecutors said in a court filing on Tuesday that Manafort’s financial assets were substantial, but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million. The investigation has cast a shadow over the first nine months of the Trump presidency. For Manafort and Gates, a conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.

0,True,"November 4, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - When the lawyer for the former campaign manager of President Donald Trump attacked the money laundering charge brought against his client as flimsy, some legal experts say he may have pinpointed a potential weakness in the indictment by U.S. special counsel Robert Mueller. Paul Manafort and his associate Rick Gates both pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges that they failed to disclose they were lobbying for pro-Russia former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich between 2006 and 2015 and laundered tens of millions of dollars by funneling the money through dozens of companies, partnerships and bank accounts. In a court filing on Thursday, Manafort defense lawyer Kevin Downing said the money laundering count, the most serious facing his client with a 20-year maximum sentence, was based on a “tenuous legal theory” tying it to his failure to register as a foreign agent of the former Ukrainian leader.  Downing did not respond to a request for comment. Mueller spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment. The language of the filing and defiant statements Downing made outside the courthouse following Manafort’s arraignment on Monday suggest the lawyer is planning an aggressive defense of the charges, the first to be made public from Mueller’s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The Kremlin has denied meddling and Trump has said there was no collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictments issued on Monday. Downing will also be seeking to suppress evidence he said was improperly obtained by search warrant, according to an additional filing on Friday. Manafort’s Virginia home was raided by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents over the summer. The money laundering statute targets financial transactions involving the proceeds of “specified unlawful activity.” According to the Manafort indictment, the unlawful activity was his violation of the U.S. Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA). Though the money laundering statute includes FARA violations, Seattle tax lawyer John Colvin said the charge against Manafort was not as straightforward as most other cases. “It doesn’t fit the normal paradigm” of money-laundering cases involving criminal activity like drug trafficking, Colvin said. “It seems like a stretch to me.”  Downing said in his Thursday filing that only six prosecutions have been brought for violating FARA in the last 50 years, producing only one conviction. By pointing out the lack of previous FARA prosecutions, former federal prosecutor Mark Lee, now a white-collar defense lawyer in Philadelphia, said Downing was likely trying to suggest Manafort may not even have known he was violating the law. The section cited by Mueller requires the FARA violation to be “knowing and willful.” Successfully casting doubt on whether Manafort intentionally violated FARA could knock out the money laundering charge, Lee said. “If you don’t have a (specific unlawful activity), you can’t by definition have a laundering,” said Lee. Former federal prosecutor Michael Padula, now a Miami defense lawyer, said parts of the money laundering statute also require funds to “promote” an ongoing criminal enterprise. That may be hard to show in the Manafort case, where the proceeds went to purchase real estate, expensive suits and Range Rovers for the conspirator’s personal use. But other lawyers said they doubted defense arguments regarding FARA would gain much traction. “The idea that somebody of Mr. Manafort’s background and sophistication would not understand that, if he did what he is alleged to have done, he would be required to file as an agent of a foreign government, is, I think, laughable,” said Chicago lawyer and former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter. Several lawyers noted that, even without the money laundering counts, Mueller had strong charges based on the failure of Manafort and Gates to report their overseas accounts to the Internal Revenue Service and that the entirety of the case appeared to be backed by strong documentary evidence. They also pointed out that Mueller could add more charges at a later date. “It’s an argument, not a get out of jail free card,” said Padula of Downing’s money laundering defense. “He’s still got a tough road ahead of him.”  ",Manafort money laundering charge in Russia probe may face challenges
0,True,"November 4, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - George H.W. Bush and his son George W. Bush did not vote for fellow Republican Donald Trump last year, says the author of a new book on the 41st and 43rd U.S. presidents in which they open up about their disapproval of the man now occupying the White House. The elder Bush voted for Hillary Clinton, while his son voted for neither Trump nor his Democratic challenger, or “none of the above,” said Mark K. Updegrove, who wrote “The Last Republicans” with the cooperation of the two Bushes. HarperCollins will publish the book on Nov. 14. In an interview with the New York Times, Updegrove said the elder Bush, 93, who served as president from 1989 to 1993, had an instinctive dislike of Trump though he did not know him personally.  In an interview during the 2016 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush told the author that Trump was a “blowhard,” driven by “a certain ego” and lacking a commitment to public service. The younger Bush, 71, who served in the White House from 2001 to 2009, believed candidate Trump lacked both humility and a necessary understanding of the presidency, Updegrove said in previewing the book about the relationship between the Bushes, written with the cooperation of the father and son.  During the campaign, George W. Bush told the author that he feared he would turn out to be the last Republican elected president. “At the time, I think he was concerned that Hillary Clinton would win,” Updegrove told the Times.  “But if you look at his values and those shared by his father and Ronald Reagan, they are very much in contrast to the values of the Republican Party today, in particular the platform that Donald Trump ran on, which is essentially protectionism and a certain xenophobia,” said Updegrove, a historian who has written several books about the presidency. Updegrove could not be reached for further comment. “The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. “If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won.”  Like many Americans, George W. Bush was surprised that Trump fared so well in last year’s Republican state primaries, where his brother Jeb, a former Florida governor, emerged as one of Trump’s most frequent targets.  During the campaign, the billionaire real estate developer, a political novice, promised to “drain the swamp” in Washington, a vow that extended to the Republican establishment, which the Bush family epitomized. The book follows a rare speech by the younger Bush in which he delivered a sweeping yet thinly veiled critique of the Trump administration’s policies and the president’s blunt style. The 43rd president decried “bullying and prejudice” in public life while defending open immigration and trade, two of the pillars of previous Republican administrations that have come under sustained attack by the new president.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Islamic State has claimed responsibility for a truck attack this week that killed eight people in the deadliest assault on New York City since Sept. 11, 2001. The militant group on Thursday described accused attacker Sayfullo Saipov, 29, as “one of the caliphate soldiers” in a weekly issue of its Al-Naba newspaper. The Uzbek immigrant was charged in federal court on Wednesday with acting in support of Islamic State by plowing a rented pickup truck down a popular riverside bike trail, crushing pedestrians and cyclists and injuring a dozen people in addition to those killed.     According to the criminal complaint against him, Saipov told investigators he was inspired by watching Islamic State propaganda videos on his cellphone, felt good about what he had done, and asked for permission to display the group’s flag in his hospital room in New York. Saipov was taken to Bellevue after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer before his arrest.  U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called for Saipov to receive the death penalty, said on Twitter on Friday that Islamic State had claimed as their soldier the “Degenerate Animal” who killed and wounded “the wonderful people on the West Side” of Lower Manhattan. “Based on that, the Military has hit ISIS “much harder” over the last two days. They will pay a big price for every attack on us!” Trump tweeted. In the Middle East the Islamic State’s self-proclaimed caliphate looked to be on the verge of defeat on Friday, with Syrian government forces seizing its last major city on one side of the border and Iraqi troops taking its last big town on the other. The group’s leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, is believed to be hiding in the desert near the frontier, and regional officials fear it will reconstitute itself as a guerrilla force, capable of waging attacks without territory to defend. Saipov’s sister believes he may have been brainwashed, and she appealed to Trump on Friday to ensure he gets a fair trial. Speaking by phone from the Uzbek capital Tashkent, she told Reuters she hoped Trump would help make sure her brother was given “more time” and “a fair trial.” In a separate interview with Radio Free Europe, she said she spoke with her brother the day before the attack and he was in a good mood. “It was a usual, good conversation,” she said. Five Argentine tourists, a Belgian woman, a New Yorker and a New Jersey man were killed in Tuesday afternoon’s attack. The attack unfolded just blocks from the site of the World Trade Center, where some 2,600 people were killed when suicide hijackers crashed two jetliners into the Twin Towers 16 years ago.    The Federal Bureau of Investigation has said it has located another Uzbek man, Mukhammadzoir Kadirov, 32, who it said was wanted for questioning as a person of interest in the attack.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - Saddled with the toughest job in American diplomacy, the chief U.S. negotiator with North Korea stands between a U.S. president who insists he doesn’t want to talk and an enemy who shows no interest in listening. While veteran State Department Asia hand Joseph Yun might be Washington’s best diplomatic hope for reducing the risk of a  devastating war on the Korean peninsula, he serves an administration riven by divisions over how to handle Pyongyang.     On the other side, North Korea’s young leader, Kim Jong Un,  shows little interest in negotiating either, at least not until he has developed a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Despite the daunting obstacles, South Korean-born Yun has told colleagues and others he hopes his diplomatic efforts can lower the temperature in a dangerous nuclear stand-off, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former U.S. officials and South Korean diplomats. Most were deeply skeptical about his chances.     “He’s such a dreamer,” a White House official said, with a note of sarcasm.     “We don’t think this is going anywhere,” said another U.S. official, although he suggested it was still worthwhile to keep engaging at some level with the North Koreans as long as Yun does not appear to be undermining President Donald Trump’s public rejection of direct negotiations. Trump has told aides that his military threats will drive North Korea to capitulate and rein in its nuclear and missile programs, four White House officials said, a view not shared among most U.S. intelligence agencies. Yun, however, is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korean officials at the United Nations and has a mandate to discuss issues beyond the release of U.S. citizens, a senior State Department official told Reuters this week. In June, he secured the release of U.S. student Otto Warmbier, who returned to the United States in a coma and died days later.  Trump headed to Asia on Friday as a senior aide warned the world is “running out of time” on the North Korea crisis. Behind the scenes, Yun is trying to keep open a fragile line of communication that could be used to prevent any miscalculation by one side or the other from spiraling into military conflict. Further aggravating tensions, two U.S. strategic bombers conducted drills over South Korea on Thursday. That followed word from South Korea’s spy agency that North Korea may be preparing another missile launch. U.S. officials have said privately that intercepting a test missile is among options under consideration, though there is disagreement within the administration about the risks. In the midst of this is Yun, a soft-spoken, 32-year foreign service veteran who took on the job a year ago, near the end of the Obama administration. He is grappling with Trump’s strident rhetoric as well as disagreement among the president’s top aides over whether saber-rattling will force Kim to capitulate and what the threshold for any military actions should be, according to several U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.  Concern about Yun’s difficulties has surfaced in Seoul, where he visits regularly and where Trump will travel next week on the second stop of his Asian tour. Several South Korean officials expressed worry that Yun’s diplomatic efforts with North Korea lack any real underpinning of support from the White House.     “Things are clearly not easy for him,” one South Korean diplomat said. “Yun is precisely that person (to talk to North Korea), but Trump is killing the whole process.” Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told reporters on Sept. 30 the United States was probing for a diplomatic opening, only to be slapped down by Trump, who told him via Twitter this was a waste of time. At the same time, CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who regularly briefs Trump on intelligence matters and is considered one of the most hawkish voices on North Korea in the president’s inner circle, has apparently gained stature.     Several officials familiar with those discussions say Pompeo is feeding Trump assessments that U.S. military threats will force Kim to bow to U.S. demands for nuclear disarmament, a position that some U.S. intelligence officers privately contest.     The CIA declined comment. A U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Yun  has become diplomatically “untethered,” not fully connected to a core U.S. approach that is emphasizing economic sanctions and the threat of military action rather than diplomacy.     The one tangible achievement of Yun’s diplomatic efforts in the past year was winning the release of 22-year-old Warmbier in secret talks with North Korean officials in Oslo and New York. Yun flew to Pyongyang in June to medically evacuate Warmbier. When Choe Son Hui, head of the North Korean foreign ministry’s North America bureau, met Yun in Oslo, she was unaware of how serious Warmbier’s condition was, a source in Washington knowledgeable about the matter said.  But once she learned about it she was “shocked” and Yun was summoned urgently to meet a North Korean diplomat in New York, which quickly led to Warmbier’s return home, the source said. Warmbier’s death complicated Yun’s efforts as it contributed to a chilling of U.S.-North Korean contacts around that time, the State Department official said.     Despite Trump’s threats of military action against Pyongyang, the State Department official said Yun’s view was “the less you engage diplomatically, the more likely you are in the dark.” Even so, Trump’s rhetoric has raised questions among allies, and possibly even in North Korea, about how serious, if at all, his administration is about diplomacy and how much of a mandate Yun may have to pursue it.     Trump “personalized” the conflict – deriding Kim as “Little Rocket Man” -  against the advice of his national security and intelligence experts, some of whom warned it could be counterproductive, a senior national security official said.     Another official pointed out, however, that Trump, who in May said he would be honored to meet Kim, had not hurled any fresh insults at Kim in recent days, raising hopes for an altered approach. A South Korean official in Seoul said it was necessary for Washington to have someone in contact with North Korea to help spur future negotiations if they are ever to take hold. But Trump’s national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, told Japan’s NHK television this week: “What we cannot afford to do is enter into these long, drawn-out negotiations that allow North Korea to use these negotiations as cover for continuing their nuclear and missile programs.” Former U.S. negotiators sympathize with Yun, whose authority to negotiate has been undercut by the tug-of-war between a White House breathing fire and a State Department pushing a peaceful solution.     “Nobody doubted my authority,” said Wendy Sherman, one of the lead U.S. negotiators who achieved the 2015 deal under which Iran agreed to restrain its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions. “All of this undermines our ability to do the job.” Robert Gallucci, who was chief U.S. negotiator during the North Korean nuclear crisis of 1994 and has had recent contact with Yun, said the envoy is “realistic about the challenges of negotiating in the current atmosphere, including the tone set by the president, but he believes in the mission even as his approach is guided by realism.” ",'He's such a dreamer:' Skepticism dogs U.S. envoy's North Korean peace efforts
0,True,"November 4, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign met Russian government officials last year, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing testimony he gave this week to a U.S. congressional committee. In numerous media interviews in recent months, the adviser, Carter Page, has either denied meeting Russian government officials during a July 2016 trip to Moscow or said he met  “mostly scholars,” the newspaper said. Page sent an email to at least one Trump campaign aide describing his insights after conversations with Russian government officials and others, the Times reported, citing a person familiar with the message. The newspaper said the email was read aloud during the closed-door testimony on Thursday to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which is investigating efforts by Russia to tip the November 2016 election in Trump’s favor and possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Russia says it did not interfere in the election and Trump has denied any collusion. Page played down the significance of the meetings in an interview with the Times on Friday. “I had a very brief hello to a couple of people. That was it,” he said. Page said one of the people he met was a “senior person,” but would not confirm the person’s identity. Special counsel Robert Mueller, who has impaneled a grand jury in his probe of the collusion allegations, charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering on Monday. It was announced the same day that another Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, had pleaded guilty early in October to lying to the FBI. Page was questioned by the FBI earlier this year and has also appeared before the grand jury as part of the special counsel’s probe, the Times said.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he did not remember much about a meeting last year with a former campaign aide who pleaded guilty last month as part of a federal probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Asked about a meeting in which aide George Papadopoulos  suggested arranging a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump told reporters: “I don’t remember much about that meeting. It was a very unimportant meeting.” According to court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Papadopoulos said at the meeting of foreign policy advisers in March 2016 “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.”  A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting at the same table with Trump as well as  Jeff Sessions, now Trump’s attorney general, and several others. Papadopoulos has pleaded guilty to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the Trump campaign and Moscow. His plea was made public this week.        Sessions is under pressure from Senate Democrats to testify again about the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts. In testimony to the Senate Judiciary committee, Sessions has denied knowing anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians or Russian government intermediaries. The president spoke before leaving for a trip to Asia, where his domestic woes are expected to dog him. Trump denies any collusion with Russia and Moscow denies interfering in the 2016 election. Sessions is also under pressure from his boss, who has made clear he thinks the Department of Justice should look into his former presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, and her campaign’s behavior with the Democratic National Committee during the presidential primary race.  Trump told reporters on Friday that many people were unhappy with the Department of Justice, including him. Those comments followed remarks he made during “The Larry O’Connor Show” on WMAL radio in which he lamented not having more say in the department’s work. “The saddest thing is, because I am the president of the United States, I am not supposed to be involved with the Justice Department. I’m not supposed to be involved with the FBI. I’m not supposed to be doing the kind of things I would love to be doing. And I am very frustrated by that,” he said. Trump on Friday repeated his urgings that the Justice Department and FBI investigate Clinton. “Everybody is asking why the Justice Department (and FBI) isn’t looking into all of the dishonesty going on with Crooked Hillary & the Dems,” he said on Twitter. His comments elicited criticism from several U.S. senators. “President Trump’s pressuring of the Justice Department and FBI to pursue cases against his adversaries and calling for punishment before trials take place are totally inappropriate and not only undermine our justice system but erode the American people’s confidence in our institutions,” Republican Senator Bob Corker, who has frequently sparred with Trump, said in a statement. Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said: “We can’t allow ourselves to become numb to the president of the United States calling on independent law enforcement organizations to investigate his political opponents. That’s characteristic of authoritarian regimes, not democracies, and it needs to stop.” Trump has expressed frustration repeatedly over the Russia investigation, which has overshadowed his administration, at times referring to it as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.” Federal investigators this week charged Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another ex-aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering and other crimes. In a court filing on Friday, Mueller estimated he would need three weeks to present his case against Manafort and Gates if it went to trial. Both men pleaded not guilty. Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing said in a filing on Friday that he would challenge what he called “evidence improperly obtained by search warrant, subpoena or otherwise.” FBI agents seized documents and other material from Manafort’s Virginia home in a July raid.

After Air Force One landed at Joint Base Hickam, Trump and his wife, Melania, were draped with traditional lei necklaces. Trump went on to nearby Camp Smith for a classified briefing from Pacific Command military leaders that officials expected would touch on North Korea and other areas. Later, he was to visit Pearl Harbor and the USS Arizona memorial for the U.S. sailors killed when Japan bombed the American naval base on Dec. 7, 1941. Trump’s 12-day trip to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, ending on Nov. 14, takes him out of Washington at a time when he has been beset by several issues. These include an intensifying federal investigation into Russian meddling in last year’s election, New York’s recovery from an attack earlier this week that killed eight people, and debate over a Republican tax-cut plan that if approved by Congress would be Trump’s first major legislative victory. The trip began just days after Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort was indicted in the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election and after his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, faced Democratic calls to appear before Congress again to clarify his previous testimony about the campaign’s Russia contacts. Amid the furor caused by the revelations, the Kremlin said on Friday that a meeting between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin at an Asian economic summit next week was being discussed, and Trump said it might happen. “We may have a meeting with Putin,” Trump told Fox News. “And, again – Putin is very important because they can help us with North Korea. They can help us with Syria. We have to talk about Ukraine.” Court documents made public on Monday also disclosed that a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty early last month to lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The documents cited a March 2016 meeting, when Trump was campaigning for the presidency, and attended by Trump and Sessions, in which Papadopoulos offered to help arrange a meeting between Trump and Putin. While Trump tweeted about developments vigorously this week, he told The New York Times on Wednesday that he was “not angry at anybody” about the case and there was nothing to suggest any collusion by his campaign and Russia. Trump’s plan for an extended absence from Washington has alarmed allies who, after seeing a healthcare reform bid fizzle, worry the tax effort could suffer without Trump to keep momentum going. On Saturday, Trump is to fly to Japan and later visit South Korea in search of a united front against North Korea before going to Beijing, where he will push Chinese President Xi Jinping to get tougher with Pyongyang. In the Fox interview, Trump was asked if he planned to be tough on China over thorny issues including trade, intellectual property theft and subsidies. “You have to understand something - very important,” he responded. “We have a problem called North Korea.” Trump said Chinese President Xi Jinping “has been pretty terrific” in cutting Pyongyang off from banking and oil systems. He added that Japan had reason to be worried about North Korea and alluded to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s campaign for a military buildup against that threat. “Well, you know Japan is a warrior nation,” he said. “I tell China and I tell everyone else that, listen, you’re going to have yourself a big problem with Japan pretty soon if you allow this to continue with North Korea.” Trump will attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Danang, Vietnam, make a state visit to Hanoi and end his trip with the Association of South East Asia Nations summit in Manila. Trump told reporters before leaving on Friday that he would spend an extra day in the Philippines. The last time a U.S. president was in Asia for so long was in late 1991 and early 1992, when President George H.W. Bush became ill at a Japanese state dinner.

In an order filed in Manhattan federal court, U.S. District Judge William Pauley said Veselnitskaya’s immigration status was “squarely within the purview of the executive branch.” Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May agreed to pay nearly $6 million to settle a U.S. government lawsuit accusing it of laundering proceeds of a $230 million tax fraud. Her temporary permission from the U.S. Department of Justice to enter the United States while working on the case has expired. Following Pauley’s order on Monday, a U.S. lawyer for Prevezon filed a letter asking that Veselnitskaya be allowed to appear by telephone at the hearing, which is scheduled for Nov. 9. The hearing is expected to focus on whether the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, as the U.S. government has maintained. Prevezon disputed that in a letter filed on Oct. 31. About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon the Netherlands had frozen at the United States’ request, according to the letter. The Netherlands lifted the freeze on Oct. 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, Prevezon’s letter said. Browder has said that the underlying $230 million tax fraud was uncovered by a former Hermitage auditor, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison in 2009. In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so they could attend hearings. Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year. Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act. The 2012 law was intended to punish Russian officials responsible for Magnitsky’s death. Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” ",Judge denies request to return to U.S. by Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr.

Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was charged in a federal court on Wednesday with driving a rented pickup truck down a riverside bike trail, crushing pedestrians and cyclists, in support of Islamic State. A dozen more people were injured in the city’s bloodiest single attack since Sept. 11, 2001. Trump called for Saipov to receive the death penalty. Speaking from Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, Saipov’s sister, Umida Saipova, said she hoped Trump would help ensure her brother was given “more time” and “a fair trial”. She told Reuters by telephone that she and her family had been shocked to see Saipov grow a long beard after he got married in 2013. Umida Saipova told Radio Free Europe (RFE) that her family believed that her brother may have been brainwashed. “We don’t know who has brainwashed him,” Saipova said. “Perhaps he’s become part of some organized group. I don’t know, honestly, how long it will take for his head to get rid of that poison, but I’m sure he will come to his senses, God willing.” She said she had spoken to her brother the day before the attack.  “He was in a good mood. It was a usual, good conversation,” she told RFE. Saipov’s mother, Mukaddas, told Reuters she last saw her son in August when she visited the United States. The attack was a “total shock” to the family, she said. “I was shocked by the news and I have been in hospital (since then) until this afternoon,” she said. Mukaddas said Sayfullo told her in August he missed Tashkent. She wanted to bring him home, but could not do that because his youngest child was only 20 days old, she said. Sayfullo never complained about his life in the United States and was able to support his family and help his parents at the same time, she said. “He was kind with all of his friends,” Mukaddas said. “No, he was not religious and never visited mosques because he was always busy with studying and then working.” Trump has tweeted of Saipov: “should move fast. DEATH PENALTY!” Umida Saipova told RFE she and her family hoped her brother would not be sentenced to death in some rushed show trial.

The program was extended 17 times between 2008 and 2012 and lapsed four times in that period. A 2012 law extended the program to September.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is pushing Republicans to change their tax-cut bill to include a repeal of the Obamacare mandate that requires individuals to buy health insurance or pay a fine, the House of Representative’s top tax lawmaker said on Friday. House tax committee Chairman Kevin Brady said he has asked the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to assess Trump’s suggestion and indicated some lawmakers were considering it. Other lawmakers have expressed concern. They said adding such a divisive provision would expose the tax bill to the fierce opposition that doomed Republicans’ efforts in July to repeal the 2010 Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare. The act was former President Barack Obama’s biggest domestic achievement. It raised taxes on wealthier Americans to fund healthcare benefits for middle- and low-income people, extending coverage to millions of previously uninsured. Democrats have defended it for years from attacks by Republicans, who see it as Washington intruding on Americans’ healthcare. Since Trump took power in January, he has pressed hard to undo much of Obama’s work. So far he has not secured any major legislative accomplishments in Congress, even though Republicans control both the House and the Senate. “The president feels very strongly about including this (the individual mandate repeal) at some step before the final process. He’s told me that twice by phone and once in person,” Brady told an event hosted by the news outlet Politico. “No decisions have been made ... Importing healthcare into a tax reform debate has consequences,” Brady said. Trump broached his idea in a tweet earlier this week, saying it would be “great” to repeal the mandate “and use those savings for further tax cuts.” Some Republican senators, such as Tom Cotton and Rand Paul, also favor this idea. Representative Tom Cole, a senior House Republican, said Friday that adding on a mandate repeal could cost the tax bill votes. “I don’t want to overload the vehicle,” Cole told reporters, adding that including the mandate repeal would probably be a “deal breaker” for Democrats. Brady also said Friday he would offer “substantive improvements” to the tax bill when his committee begins considering the legislation next week. He gave no details. The tax bill released Thursday would cut tax rates for businesses, individuals and families. Republicans hope to pass it through Congress by year’s end. Democrats oppose it as a give-away to the rich and large corporations. ",Trump urges adding anti-Obamacare provision to tax bill: lawmaker
0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews," (This version of the Nov. 2 story corrects paragraph 8 to say that Trump lost Nevada in 2016, instead of that he won Nevada) By Laila Kearney and Karen Pierog NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Democratic-leaning states are set to bankroll a big chunk of the tax cuts unveiled in a Republican tax plan on Thursday, as the plan slashes deductions used the most by residents of states that voted against Donald Trump in the 2016 elections. The bill, introduced by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means on Thursday, took aim at state and local tax deductions as one part of its plan to pay for reductions in taxes elsewhere. Overall, the plan would reduce federal revenues by roughly $1.5 trillion over 10 years.   The bill eliminates the most widely-used deduction - income tax - and caps property tax deductions, the second most-used, at $10,000. State and local deductions are used largely by high-tax states that tend to vote Democratic in presidential elections and local officials say the tax bill appeared to divide its benefits and burdens along partisan lines.  “I do think this has been developed in a way that looks at who were the prevailing forces in the presidential election and who were not,” Kevin Sullivan, Connecticut’s Commissioner of Revenue Services, told Reuters. Connecticut is one of several high-tax Democratic states where, local officials say, middle-class households will end up paying more taxes under the Republican plan. Among those potentially hardest-hit are California and New York with state income tax rates of 13.3 percent - the nation’s highest - and 8.82 percent respectively, according to a recent report by the Tax Foundation. That group also includes New Jersey, Minnesota and Oregon - all of which have voted for Trump’s Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election. By contrast, out the seven states that levy no income tax, Trump only lost Washington and Nevada, while winning Alaska, Florida, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming. “By eliminating or rolling back state and local tax deductibility, Washington is sending a death blow to New York’s middle class families and our economy,” New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat and one of the most outspoken opponents of the bill, wrote in a letter to Trump this week. “It’s clear this is a hostile political act aimed at the economic heart of New York.” To be sure, some Republican legislators from high-tax states, including Representative Lee Zeldin, of New York, have opposed the bill. The legislation would also end a tax exemption for billions of dollars of so-called private activity bonds issued by state and local governments annually to finance affordable housing, non-profit hospitals and colleges, as well as airports and port facilities - a measure that would affect Democrat and Republican states alike. Conservative groups have defended the tax bill, saying it would simplify the tax code, reduce overall burden on the economy and spread the costs and burdens more fairly. “The principles outlined in this federal tax reform effort will provide pro-growth tax rate reductions, while adding fairness and simplicity to the tax code,” Jonathan Williams, chief economist at the American Legislative Exchange Council, an  organization of conservative state legislators, said in an email. Nick Samuels, a senior credit officer at Moody’s Investors Service, said the proposed bill would hit primarily high–income and high-tax states like California, New York and New Jersey, making it harder for them to raise revenue from income and property taxes. Officials in the affected states say millions of residents, not just high-earners, would suffer because of lost tax breaks and less funding available for public services. In New Jersey, 1.8 million households deduct a total of $17 billion in state income or sales taxes and 1.6 million households deduct a cumulative $14.9 billion in local property taxes from their federal taxes, according to the nonpartisan think-tank New Jersey Policy Perspective. “This deal is still terrible for New Jersey’s working families, with big tax breaks that overwhelmingly go to the wealthiest 1 percent, setting up deep cuts to programs and services that we all rely on,” said Jon Whiten, the group’s vice president. Minnesota’s Democratic Governor Mark Dayton warned on Monday that the legislation would eliminate tax deductions totaling over $12.3 billion annually for 900,000 families in his state. The states with the highest property tax collections per capita include New Jersey, New Hampshire, Connecticut and New York, according to the Tax Foundation. For California, the Internal Revenue Service reported that approximately one in three residents took a state or local  deduction in 2015, totaling roughly $113 billion, according to H.D. Palmer, a spokesman for the state’s finance department.     “Congress is trying to rush consideration of a tax proposal that will have profound and widespread impacts on California,” Palmer said. National Conference of State Legislatures President and Republican South Dakota state senator Deb Peters in a statement called the legislation “an attack on the sovereignty of states.” ","Republican tax plan a blow to Democratic states, officials say"
0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea called on Friday for a halt to what it called “brutal sanctions”, saying the measures - imposed after its latest nuclear test - constituted genocide. “Today the U.S.-led racket of brutal sanctions and pressure against the DPRK constitutes contemporary human rights violation and genocide,” the North Korean mission to the United Nations in Geneva said in a statement. The sanctions regime “threatens and impedes the enjoyment by the people of DPRK of their human rights in all sectors”, it said. The call for an immediate end to the sanctions comes as U.S. President Donald Trump sets off on a trip to Asia - including China, South Korea and Japan - looking for help to pressure North Korea to stand down from the nuclear crisis.  The global community has been ramping up the pressure on the isolated country after it conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far, on Sept. 3.  Last month the United States unilaterally imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities over what it called serious human rights abuses, including forced labor. In September the U.N. Security Council strengthened its sanctions, including export bans as well as asset freezes and travel bans on various officials, North Korea’s response follows a U.N. expert last month saying international sanctions may be hurting key economic sectors and hampering the human rights of Pyongyang’s citizens. The sanctions meant that “some unprincipled countries have blocked the delivery of medical equipment and medicines”, the North Korean mission said on Friday, with the supplies destined for children and mothers in the country. “All types of anti-human rights and inhumane sanctions against the DPRK should be terminated immediately and thoroughly,” it said.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Twitter Inc faced questions on Friday about its approach to internal security after a company employee briefly deactivated U.S. President Donald Trump’s account. The 11-minute blackout of the @realDonaldTrump account late on Thursday drew widespread attention to the microblogging site. Trump frequently uses Twitter to announce policy, assail his adversaries and to tangle with countries, including North Korea, over world affairs. Some users voiced fears that future employee interference or technology glitches involving Trump’s account could threaten national security.  The incident also came as Twitter grapples with overall criticism of its handling of account suspensions, user abuse and ever-changing terms of service.   Twitter said in a tweet on Friday: “We have implemented safeguards to prevent this from happening again. We won’t be able to share all details about our internal investigation or updates to our security measures, but we take this seriously and our teams are on it.” A company representative declined to answer questions including how many employees can suspend an account or what special protections there are for high-profile users like Trump. Trump was back on Twitter soon after the account was restored, and the employee did not send or alter any tweets.  Cyber security experts had previously speculated Twitter could have installed special protections on Trump’s account, such as the ability to only access it from certain devices. “We have learned that this was done by a Twitter customer-support employee who did this on the employee’s last day. We are conducting a full internal review,” Twitter said in a tweet late on Thursday. “We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to prevent this from happening again,” the company said in an earlier tweet. Reuters could not determine how many Twitter employees had the authority to delete accounts or if any had the ability to tamper with them in other ways, such as by sending bogus tweets.  “In all seriousness: We need accountability for social media sites,” Ken Meyer, who served as digital director for former Vice President Joe Biden, tweeted. “Lone employees shouldn’t be able to change statements from the President.” Speaking on condition of anonymity, a former Twitter employee said it was unlikely a worker with suspension privileges would also be able to hijack an account to send out messages.   “Different types of access,” the former employee said. “I’m not sure anyone at Twitter can tweet from someone else’s account.”  Another person familiar with Twitter operations, speaking on condition of anonymity, said employees currently cannot post from a user’s account, change or even view a user’s password, which is encrypted. Joseph Lorenzo Hall, chief technologist at the nonprofit Center for Democracy and Technology, said the suspension reflected a need for Twitter to be more transparent about its ability to control accounts but also demonstrated the perils of a head of state relying on digital technology as a primary mode of communication. “It would be nice to rely on older forms of policy communication with solid foundations,” he said, adding that Twitter should require two-person controls for certain high-profile accounts. The New York Times on Friday reported the rogue employee was in fact a contractor, citing two anonymous sources familiar with the incident.  Twitter and other tech companies have ramped up their reliance on contractors due to pressure to respond more quickly and thoroughly to content violations. While the companies “are desperately reliant upon human nuance and sophistication for decision making, human will is quite a risk,” Sarah Roberts, a UCLA professor who studies such contractors, said in a tweet. “Ain’t that a bind?” The company on Friday separately announced minor updates to its rules, including more clarity on what actions could result in an account suspension. It was the latest in a string of iterative changes amid criticism the platform too slowly and inconsistently responds to abuse. Twitter shares were up 1.9 percent in afternoon trading.  Trump, who has nearly 42 million Twitter followers, responded to the temporary loss of his account by boasting about his wide reach on the service. “My Twitter account was taken down for 11 minutes by a rogue employee,” Trump said on Twitter early on Friday. “I guess the word must finally be getting out-and having an impact.” He has used Twitter to attack opponents and promote his policies, both during the 2016 presidential campaign and since taking office in January. Thursday’s incident also raised questions about how Twitter secures the official @potus presidential account and other accounts that could potentially influence world events. Technology companies including Twitter are, meanwhile, under attack from U.S. lawmakers for failing to stem the spread of Russian propaganda and misinformation on their platforms. Twitter in particular has long been criticized for not doing enough to police its platform and respond to complaints of harassment.  Though the temporary deletion of the Trump account sparked a flood of criticism from Twitter users, many of the president’s critics also said they were happy to see the account disabled.  In 2013, hackers took control of the main account for the Associated Press and tweeted that explosions at the White House had injured then-President Barack Obama, causing stocks to briefly plunge.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives will introduce bills as soon as Monday to toughen U.S. foreign investment rules amid growing concern about Chinese deals, according to a source familiar with the legislation. Senator John Cornyn, a member of the Republican leadership who is on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will introduce a Senate bill to broaden the government’s power to stop foreign purchases of U.S. firms by strengthening the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). CFIUS is an interagency panel led by the Treasury Department that reviews proposed transactions to review national security concerns. Rep. Robert Pittenger, a North Carolina Republican, will introduce an identical bill in the House of Representatives. At least four Democrats will back the bills, including Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut and Rep. Dave Loebsack of Iowa, said a source who spoke on background to protect business relationships. “The likelihood of Congress acting on this is pretty significant,” said the source. Rep. Denny Heck, a Democrat from Washington, said he was concerned about China at least partly because of allegations of stolen U.S. intellectual property.  “China’s actions are clear – they are cheating the system. They are evading the rules meant to prevent them from accessing technology critical to our national security and we need to do something to stop them sooner rather than later,” he said in a statement. “With these changes, we hope to modernize and update the law in order to meet today’s threats from around the globe.” CFIUS already has a reputation for being tough on high-tech deals involving China in particular, and has blocked transactions that involve sophisticated semiconductors. It has become more conservative since President Donald Trump was inaugurated amid growing political and economic tensions between the United States and China. Since the inauguration, the panel has balked at approving a broader range of deals from China, according to lawyers who specialize in representing proposed transactions to the board. The bills would expand CFIUS’ power to look at smaller investments and joint ventures, according to sources who have read drafts of the bills.  There have been calls for “green field” investment to be subject to CFIUS scrutiny, but under the bills CFIUS will only review these to ensure they are not close to sensitive military installations, the first source said. A green field investment is when a parent company starts a new firm overseas from the ground up. ",Bipartisan bills expected to toughen U.S. foreign investment rules

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three Republican U.S. lawmakers called on Friday for Robert Mueller to resign as special counsel investigating Russia and the 2016 U.S. election, the latest in a series of conservatives’ criticisms of the FBI and Justice Department during the probe of how Moscow may have influenced the campaign. Representatives Matt Gaetz, Andy Biggs and Louis Gohmert accused Mueller of a conflict of interest because he was director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation when former President Barack Obama’s administration approved an agreement allowing a Russian company to buy a Canadian company that owned 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies. President Donald Trump’s fellow Republicans have been calling for an investigation into the Uranium One deal, amid news of Mueller’s first indictments of Trump associates as the special counsel investigates allegations that the Trump campaign colluded with Moscow. Moscow denies any effort to influence the election, and Trump has dismissed the investigation as a “witch hunt.” On Monday, the day the indictments became public, White House Chief of Staff John Kelly said a special counsel should be appointed to investigate Democrats over the uranium deal. Another group of Republican lawmakers, including House of Representatives Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte launched an investigation last week to examine issues including the role of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Trump’s 2016 opponent, in the uranium deal. Democrats have dismissed the Republicans’ activities as a partisan effort to distract from Mueller’s probe and from efforts to ensure that a foreign government, Moscow, does not influence future U.S. elections. Gaetz, Biggs and Gohmert are all members of the House Judiciary Committee, which has oversight over the FBI and Department of Justice. Gaetz has called for investigations of issues related to Clinton previously, including accusing former FBI Director James Comey of colluding with Mueller on the FBI’s investigation of Clinton’s emails.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Friday approved legislation to continue a federal insurance program for millions of lower-income children and pregnant women, but with an ongoing funding battle it could be weeks before the program gets more money. The House Republican measure was approved 242-174 largely along party lines. It would continue the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) for five years. But Democrats warned the partisan House approach would not fly in the Senate, further delaying cash for the program that expired over a month ago. “This bill is going nowhere ... the Senate will not take it up, and we will be waiting around until Christmas” to get funding, Democratic Representative Frank Pallone warned.  Republicans control 52 of the Senate’s 100 seats, and 60 votes are needed for passage there. CHIP, which provides health insurance to about 9 million children, has been a bipartisan program since its creation 20 years ago and reauthorizing funding has not been contentious - until now. Under President Donald Trump and a Republican-controlled Congress, healthcare issues have become highly politicized as Republicans have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace Obamacare, a top Trump campaign promise. The program’s funding lapsed on Sept. 30, but most states have enough money to continue it past 2017. Still, 11 states, including Colorado, California, Utah, Ohio and Pennsylvania expect to exhaust their funding by the end of the year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Another 21 states anticipate running out of money by the end of March 2018. The House bill extends the program for five years, and continues funding of community health centers for two years. It also includes $1 billion for Medicaid programs in Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, hard hit by recent hurricanes. The bill became controversial after Republicans added provisions that would affect the Affordable Care Act, former Democratic President Barack Obama’s signature domestic policy achievement. They include slashing funding from the law’s Prevention and Public Health Fund, which among other things helps fight the opioid epidemic, and making it easier to kick people off Obamacare plans for non-payment of premiums. However, Republican Representative Greg Walden pointed out the bill would block for two years the Medicaid cuts for hospitals that would otherwise occur under Obamacare.  Democrats criticized the legislation for asking Medicare’s wealthiest one percent of beneficiaries, those who make more than $40,000 each month, to pay more to help fund health insurance for low-income children.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unsure whether his top diplomat, Rex Tillerson, would remain in his post for the rest of Trump’s term in the White House and was “not happy” that some State Department staff were not supporting his agenda.     In an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News late Thursday, Trump attacked the department under Secretary of State Tillerson and said he alone determines U.S. foreign policy.     “The one that matters is me,” Trump said. “I’m the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that’s what the policy is going to be.” Asked if he planned to keep Tillerson on board for the rest of his term, Trump told Fox, “Well, we’ll see. I don’t know.”    Trump left on Friday on a trip to Asia with Tillerson following months of conflict between the two. Trump’s comments drew criticism in Congress, where many   fellow Republicans have joined Democrats in objecting to Trump’s plan to slash spending on diplomacy and foreign aid, and his failure to fill key foreign policy jobs. “One would hope that if he’s the only one that matters that he at least gets some feedback from top staff who perhaps can know a little bit more about some of these things than he does,” Representative Eliot Engel, top Democrat on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters. Tensions between Trump, a real estate developer and reality television star in office since January, and Tillerson,  former chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), resurfaced last month amid reports Tillerson had called Trump a “moron” and considered resigning. Tillerson later said he never considered leaving. Trump  said they had a good relationship but criticized Tillerson as weak. Tillerson’s State Department has also been at odds with the White House over global issues including rising tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program. Richard Haass, president of the Council of Foreign Relations, said Trump’s comments spelled trouble not just for the current secretary but for overall foreign policy.  “It’s not just about Rex Tillerson, it’s about who comes after Rex Tillerson. If the president is not determined to make sure his secretary of state will succeed, the secretary of state can’t succeed,” Haass told CBS News. Tillerson has made overhauling the department a top priority and tightened control by consolidating his authority. Critics have decried the reorganization and unfilled jobs at a time when international crises continue around the world. At a recent meeting of former national security advisers, former Secretary of State Colin Powell told H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security advisor, that the administration was gutting State. McMaster replied that there were people who did not support the president’s agenda, two people present told Reuters. On Thursday, Trump said many of the posts were not needed and he is “not happy” with others already there.  “I want my vision, but my vision is my vision,” he said. “Rex is in there working hard ... he’s doing the best he can.” (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped words in 11th paragraph) ",Trump says unsure if Tillerson will remain secretary of state

In the lawsuit filed on Thursday, the groups asked the court to compel the Interior Department and the White House Council on Environmental Quality to provide documents on the department’s review of a group of national monuments, where industrial activities like mining and oil drilling are prohibited. Interior put more than a dozen monuments under review earlier this year. Several news outlets reported the department had determined which of those it would shrink, but it has not released a formal report. U.S. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, pledged last week to reduce the size of two monuments in Utah, according to U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch. Interior Department and White House officials referred questions about the lawsuit to the U.S. Justice Department. A Justice Department spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  The environmental groups, which also include the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Wilderness Society, said Interior and the White House council were not meeting appropriate deadlines under the Freedom of Information Act. That law requires government agencies to release their documents to the public upon request and lays out a timeline for doing so. “By failing to provide the requested records, Defendants are actively impeding Plaintiffs’ access to government information and blocking Plaintiffs’ ability to carry out their organizational missions,” the lawsuit said.

Trump leaves on Friday for Hawaii, the first stop en route to Asia where he will visit Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. It will be the longest Asia tour by an American president in more than 25 years. His goal will be to increase international support for an  effort to deprive North Korea of resources as leverage to coerce it to give up nuclear weapons. “The president recognizes that we’re running out of time (to deal with North Korea) and will ask all nations to do more,” White House national security adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters at a briefing. As part of the U.S. effort to push China, North Korea’s neighbor and main trading partner, to put more pressure on Pyongyang, the U.S. Treasury issued a formal ruling on Thursday cutting off from the U.S. financial system a Chinese bank it accused of laundering money for North Korean concerns. In June, the Treasury Department declared the Bank of Dandong a “primary money laundering concern” for serving as a gateway for North Korea to access the U.S. and international financial systems despite U.S. and U.N. sanctions. [nL1N1JQ1I4]  South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers on Thursday that North Korea may be planning a new missile test, after brisk activity was spotted at its research facilities.

[nL2N1N827P] “The bilateral continuous bomber presence mission was planned in advance ... and was not in response to any current event,” the Air Force said in a statement. McMaster said Trump would urge countries with the most influence over Pyongyang to “convince its leaders that the pursuit of nuclear weapons is a dead end” and that it must denuclearize. “And he will remind friend and foe alike that the United States stands ready to defend itself and our allies using the full range of our capabilities,” said McMaster. China will be perhaps Trump’s most critical stop in Asia. There he will ask Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to rein in North Korea. Senior U.S. officials say China considers North Korea a strategic asset and is reluctant to cut off resources to Pyongyang for fear of triggering a refugee wave. McMaster said Trump, who has approved a variety of sanctions against North Korea, is at the beginning of his drive for Pyongyang to give up nuclear weapons. Trump has warned he would “totally destroy” North Korea if it threatened the United States or its allies. “I think we have to be a little patient here for at least a few months to see what more we and others can do, including China,” said McMaster. “I don’t think we need to reassess our strategy now. I think we have to give it a couple of months, a few months, and then see what adjustments we might need to make.” Trump is expected to press Xi to reduce oil exports to North Korea and coal imports from Pyongyang and limit financial transactions.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Ivanka Trump, U.S. President Donald Trump’s daughter and informal adviser, told a summit in Tokyo on Friday that the world must boost women and minority participation in the fields of science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM). Ivanka Trump, seen as an important influence on her father, has made women’s issues one of her signature policy areas since beginning her role at the White House. Her comments came ahead of her father’s trip to Asia - his first since taking office in January - that begins in Japan on Sunday. “Female and minority participation in STEM fields is moving in the wrong direction,” she said at the World Assembly for Women summit. “We must create equal participation in these traditionally male-dominated sectors of our economy.”  She said her father’s tax reforms - unveiled by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday - would benefit American families. “We are seeking to simplify the tax code, lower rates, expand the child tax credit, eliminate the marriage penalty, and put more money back in the pockets of hard-working Americans,” she told a meeting room in a Tokyo hotel that had a number of empty seats. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said his government was aiming to mobilize women in Japan’s workforce and boost economic growth, launching policies such as improved childcare in his “Womenomics” program. “We’ve put our full strength into creating an environment where it’s easy for women to work,” Abe said in an opening address to the conference. “I really feel that Japan has come a long way,” he said.  Japan’s gender gap remains wide despite such efforts, with little progress made since Abe vowed at the United Nations in 2013 to create “a society where women can shine”. Japan ranked 114 out of 144 in the World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap report - sandwiched between Guinea and Ethiopia and down 13 places since Abe took power. Abe appointed only two women to ministerial posts in a Cabinet reshuffle in August, down from three and five respectively in his previous two cabinets. Only 14 percent of Japan’s lawmakers are women. Men also dominate decision-making in business in Japan. Only 3.7 percent of Japanese-listed company executives were women at the end of July, according to the Cabinet Office, barely changed from 3.4 percent a year earlier.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans unveiled long-delayed legislation on Thursday to deliver deep tax cuts that President Donald Trump has promised, setting off a frantic race in Congress to give him his first major legislative victory. The 429-page bill, representing what would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s, called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks for companies and individuals. Congressional passage of this legislation that would affect nearly every U.S. company and family was far from certain, and some business groups quickly came out against it. Contentious provisions will test Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to deliver any major legislative achievements for Trump since the businessman-turned-politician became president in January. A number of provisions would hit taxpayers in Democratic-leaning states hardest, like rolling back deductions for state and local taxes and cutting in half the popular mortgage interest deduction.  The legislation, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, produces new advantages for rich Americans through lowered corporate taxes, phasing out the estate tax and dumping the alternative minimum tax.  “This is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans. Are we going to let the defenders of the status quo win and see our country continue down this downward spiral?” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asked, despite data showing about eight straight years of economic growth. Meeting with Ryan and other key House Republicans, Trump told the lawmakers he was counting on them to maintain the momentum for tax cuts, and repeated his request that Congress send him the legislation to sign into law by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. That is an ambitious timetable for such a long, multi-faceted piece of legislation that will face a ferocious lobbying battle among business sectors affected by the bill and fierce opposition from many Democrats. Trump called the bill an “important step” toward tax relief for Americans, adding in a statement, “We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.” The bill presented by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee would consolidate the current number of tax brackets to four from seven: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. An earlier Republican tax outline had called for cutting the top rate for the highest earners to 35 percent. The National Association of Home Builders blasted the legislation, saying it would damage home prices and punish homeowners in urban areas.  “We’re concerned if enacted, this bill will throw us back into another housing recession,” Jerry Howard, the group’s president, said in an interview. The group said the provision in the bill capping the interest deduction for future home purchases at $500,000 - half the current amount - was unacceptable. Howard said 7 million homes are currently above $500,000 and in high-cost regions like Washington, D.C., New York City, California and Hawaii, the impact would be felt the most.  The bill would repeal the existing deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, and would cap the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. Those provisions would most affect Americans in higher-tax states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois. The National Federation of Independent Business, the influential small business lobby, also came out against the bill, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby backed it. Ryan said the typical family of four would save $1,182 annually on taxes under the bill.  With Democrats solidly opposed to legislation they see as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would expand the federal deficit, Republicans can ill afford to lose many in their own ranks as they aim to pass the bill in the coming weeks. “Ultimately, what the American people really get from this tax plan is a huge bill for the debt incurred to pay for tax breaks that line the pockets of Donald Trump personally along with his billionaire buddies. Like a Trump University degree, it is phony,” said Democratic congressman Lloyd Doggett. The bill’s architects avoided one showdown by deciding not to make changes to the popular tax-deferred 401(k) retirement savings program. The bill would roughly double the standard deduction for individuals and families. But it would repeal a personal exemption of $4,050 that taxpayers can currently claim for themselves, their spouse and any dependents. The legislation would also phase out tax-exempt financing for sports stadiums and subject large private universities to 1.4-percent excise tax on investment income. It would also repeal a long standing prohibition on religious institutions being involved in political activities. The bill would create a new family tax credit and double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, while also allowing small businesses to write off loan interest. The bill would cap the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on “pass-through” income of 39.6 percent. It would set standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. It would create a new 10-percent tax on U.S. companies’ high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis, in a move to prevent companies from moving profits overseas. Foreign businesses operating in the United States would face a tax of up to 20 percent on payments they make overseas from their American operations. U.S. equities have rallied in 2017 to a series of record highs, partly on expectations of deep corporate tax cuts. Shares of U.S. homebuilders fell after the bill was released, with luxury homebuilders including Toll Brothers taking the biggest hit. As investors parsed its provisions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up modestly and the S&P 500 was down slightly. Investors cautioned the tax plan was preliminary and it was too soon to gauge the effect on specific industries. [nL2N1N81IG] The Ways and Means Committee will begin formal consideration of the bill next week before the full House can vote on it. It also must pass the Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer 52-48 majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to approve a major healthcare overhaul sought by Trump.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews," (This version of the November 2nd story corrects amount to be raised to $25 million instead of $35 million in the last paragraph) By Ian Simpson WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Construction of the Dwight D. Eisenhower National Memorial kicked off symbolically on Thursday after years of opposition to the late U.S. president’s $150 million monument by critics who balked at its cost and size. Gilded shovels flashed as lawmakers, architect Frank Gehry and Eisenhower family members turned a trough of earth at a ceremonial groundbreaking for the four-acre (1.6-hectare) memorial to the 34th president and World War Two Allied commander. “At last, at last, we’re building at last,” said Republican U.S. Senator Pat Roberts of Kansas, the head of the memorial’s commission, as he held up the monument’s building permit. “Let’s get the job done.”  Dedication of the monument just off the National Mall and near the National Air and Space Museum is anticipated for May 8, 2019, the 75th anniversary of the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War Two. Congress approved the memorial in 1999, but opposition to Gehry’s plans stalled it for years. Criticism focused on eight-story-high columns supporting a steel tapestry portraying the Kansas prairies where Eisenhower grew up. In 2014, a House of Representatives’ committee report referred to the memorial as a “five-star folly” plagued by rising costs, construction delays and design flaws. The Republican president’s family dropped its objections last year after Gehry reduced the size and changed the tapestry’s image from Kansas farmland to Normandy beaches - the scene of the Allies’ 1944 D-Day invasion of France - to better reflect Eisenhower’s international stature. Susan Eisenhower, the president’s granddaughter, on Thursday downplayed the hurdles the memorial had faced and noted that the one to President Franklin Roosevelt had taken 43 years from conception to its opening in 1997. “I’d say we’re way ahead of the timeline,” she said to laughter from onlookers, who included a handful of World War Two veterans. Gehry’s plan got final approval from Washington’s planning and arts commissions this fall, and the site will be known as Eisenhower Park. Some critics remain. “It’s a national embarrassment that we are building a grandiose, inscrutable and ugly memorial that virtually no one likes,” Justin Shubow, president of the National Civic Art Society, said in an email. Congress, which had long refused to fund the project, allocated $45 million for construction in the current fiscal year.  Republican President Donald Trump’s administration is asking for another $40 million next year, and the memorial’s commission also is halfway to its goal of raising $25 million in private funds.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Many of the immigration initiatives launched by the Trump administration in recent weeks target one kind of migrant: children. The measures are aimed at expelling young people already in the United States illegally and preventing new ones from crossing into the country.      Some of the policy shifts have generated headlines, including Trump’s decision in September to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA. That measure, put in place by former President Barack Obama in 2012, allowed nearly 800,000 young people brought to the United States illegally as children the ability to live, work and study in the country without fear of deportation.     Other proposals and actions have received far less attention. The Trump administration has recently intensified scrutiny of abused and neglected foreign minors applying to stay in the United States. It is seeking to restrict who qualifies for special protections granted to children crossing the border alone. And it is stepping up prosecutions of adults who paid smugglers to bring unaccompanied kids to the United States.  The White House also announced this fall it will end a program allowing Central American minors to apply for U.S. asylum while still living abroad. At the same time, the administration is exploring ways to scrap legal protections that limit how long and under what conditions children can be held in immigration detention centers. In response to questions about the changes in immigration policy focused on children, the White House said that relevant agencies were reviewing ways to help “law enforcement professionals to do their jobs and keep the country safe.” (For a graphic on Trump policies targeting young immigrants, see: tmsnrt.rs/2zaT2BK)   Trump came to office promising to crack down on immigration. That message grew stronger this week in the wake of a terrorist attack in New York by a 29-year-old immigrant awarded a green card through a visa lottery program the president has now vowed to end. Some of his messaging on child immigrants also reflects security concerns. In a speech in Long Island in July, Trump called out “alien minors” as responsible for gang-related killings in the United States.  “These are animals,” he said of members of the notorious Central American gang MS-13. In addition, the administration says it wants to prevent children from undertaking perilous journeys to the United States and eliminate fraud from programs for young immigrants. “The President wants to stop the incentives for vulnerable children to come here illegally,” Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a speech in Texas in October. In another speech last month, he blamed “dirty immigration lawyers” for encouraging clients to game the process. Some immigration advocates see the president’s focus on young border crossers differently. Children are perceived sympathetically by the public and have more legal protections than other immigrants, giving authorities less flexibility to deport them, they say. It is “in the administration’s interest to paint unaccompanied children as gang bangers and not as asylum seekers fleeing violence and abuse,” said American Civil Liberties Union attorney Michael Tan. “The administration wants the public to perceive these children as monsters and not people deserving of refuge.” President Trump is not the first president to try to crack down on minors crossing the border illegally. Obama prioritized the removal of young immigrants after the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border peaked at more than 68,000 in 2014, most of them from violence-torn Central America.   Trump campaigned on a promise to toughen enforcement further, saying Obama’s policies had failed. After he took office early in 2017, apprehensions of unaccompanied minors dropped sharply, to a low of just over 990 in April from more than 4,400 in January. But the number of arrests has begun rising again, with nearly 3,000 unaccompanied minors caught in August, according to government data.  One target of the administration is a legal agreement dating back to 1997 that bars the government from holding child immigrants for long periods.  The so-called Flores settlement addressed what advocates said were harsh conditions for kids held in immigration detention facilities. To settle a class-action lawsuit, the government agreed to release minors quickly to adult relatives or licensed childcare programs, or to put them in the “least restrictive” setting possible if other options were not available. Faced with 2014 surge in illegal crossings, the Obama administration fought broad legal interpretations of the agreement in court to make it easier to detain families. The Trump White House now wants to scrap it altogether. An internal memo dated Sept. 8 written by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and reviewed by Reuters called the two-decade-old legal agreement “unworkable,” and presented four options to fight or end it. Among them: DHS could ask a federal court to dissolve the Flores deal, a move the memo acknowledged could prove difficult given past rulings that have bolstered the agreement. A DHS spokesperson said the agency would not comment on “internal working documents.” The administration is focused not just on stopping illegal border crossings by children but also on limiting their ability to stay once they reach the United States. One of its targets is SIJS, or special immigrant juvenile status, a program for foreign minors who have been abused, abandoned or neglected.  To qualify, children have to prove their mistreatment in U.S. family court, after which they are protected from deportation and allowed to apply for green cards. SIJS applications ballooned following the 2014 surge in unaccompanied minors. The program’s numbers hit 19,475 in the 2016 fiscal year, a more than 1,000 percent increase from 1,646 in fiscal year 2010. The White House and immigration hard-liners in Congress say lawyers have taken advantage of the program by using it for kids who are not in the kind of peril the statute was intended to address. Chief among their complaints is that children abandoned by one parent can apply for SIJS even if another parent is providing adequate care. The administration is already taking steps to limit the program. Immigration attorneys say government scrutiny of SIJS petitions has increased, slowing the approval process and leaving kids in limbo. Approvals from April to June totaled 1,862, down more than 50 percent from the previous three-month period, according to data from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).  USCIS acknowledged that it has stepped up scrutiny of petitions “to ensure that they meet criteria for approval.” But the agency stressed that the majority of applications are still approved.  From January through June of this year 5,671 SIJS petitions were approved while 403 applications were denied. Meanwhile pending applications are ballooning, totaling 22,745 through June, as new petitions grow.  The delays are creating confusion for young immigrants such as 20-year-old Drucilla. She says her mother neglected her after bringing her to the United States illegally from Jamaica when she was three years old following her father’s murder. Drucilla eventually moved in with an aunt in New York and applied for SIJS last year in order to stay in the country. Drucilla, who asked only be identified by her first name, said she is nervous about the outcome of her case after U.S. officials recently requested additional documents to substantiate her claims. “Growing up, nothing was ever in my control,” she said. “I have a lot of anxiety.” See how the administration’s actions affect people, communities, institutions and companies at The Trump Effect www.reuters.com/trump-effect ",New Trump immigration efforts aim to stop child border crossers

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Just days after the killing of a prominent Cambodian government critic last year during a crackdown by the country’s longtime leader, President Barack Obama dispatched Washington’s chief human rights envoy to Phnom Penh to attend the activist’s funeral. In meetings with Cambodian authorities, then-Assistant Secretary of State Tom Malinowski warned the military not to intervene in the political turmoil or else crucial U.S. ties would suffer, sending a clear message that America stood behind the opposition. It was one example of the kind of high-level, rapid-response U.S. diplomacy that President Donald Trump has so far avoided in Cambodia even as the Southeast Asian nation – together with many of its neighbors - has lurched increasingly away from the democratic path. As Trump prepares to depart on his first Asia tour, which will bring him face-to-face with a number of leaders with poor human rights records, his administration has been taking a more muted approach than his predecessor to such concerns, said current and former U.S. officials, rights activists and diplomats. In addition to the situation in Cambodia, they cite what they see as a slow, overly cautious response to Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis, Trump’s failure to publicly call out autocratic leaders he meets over rights abuses, an eagerness to engage with the Philippines’ controversial president, Rodrigo Duterte, and a less vocal approach to human rights in China.  National security adviser H.R. McMaster pushed back against the notion that Trump would downplay human rights on his Nov. 3-14 trip, saying he would speak out “about the importance of promoting freedom and individual rights.” When asked why Trump condemns U.S. adversaries such as Syria and Venezuela on human rights grounds but not the Philippines, Turkey and Russia, McMaster told reporters on Thursday: “How much does it help to yell about these problems? It hasn’t really delivered in recent history anyway.” The dominant view within Trump’s White House is that under his “America First” world-view human rights concerns related to allies and strategically important countries should be managed gently to avoid impeding job-creating business deals or undercutting security efforts such as isolating North Korea, several Trump aides said. Soft-pedaling human rights may also help Washington avoid alienating countries in Southeast Asia that it wants to keep from moving further into China’s orbit, those aides said.  Beijing puts little pressure on its neighbors over such issues. This approach, however, has sown frustration among some U.S. diplomats who deal with human rights and disappointed dissidents in several countries, according to Reuters interviews with more than a dozen people involved in these matters in Washington and Asian capitals. The failure so far to fill several senior Asia and human rights posts at the State Department is a further handicap, they say. Obama’s former top Asia adviser, Evan Medeiros, is one of those critical of what he sees as the Trump administration’s lower-key approach to human rights. “It’s a false dichotomy to say that somehow a focus on human rights detracts from American security or economic well-being,” he said. Even under Obama, however, there were some in the human rights community who at times found fault with U.S. actions.  While the Nobel Peace Prize laureate was praised for stressing human rights in Asia-Pacific trade negotiations, he faced criticism that he suspended sanctions on Myanmar prematurely and lifted a ban on the sale of lethal arms to Vietnam. “He spoke eloquently and sometimes delivered,” said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director for Human Rights Watch. “But he also didn’t fully use the carrots and sticks of American power.” Though Trump has said little on human rights beyond condemning adversaries such as North Korea and Venezuela, United Nations envoy Nikki Haley has been one of the few top aides who have spoken out more broadly. She visited sub-Saharan Africa and pressed leaders to tackle political and humanitarian problems. Trump set the tone in Saudi Arabia in May when he told an audience that included monarchs and strongmen from the Muslim world: “We are not here to lecture.” He has hosted several autocratic leaders - including Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, who had been frozen out of White House visits since leading a 2014 military coup - but has steered clear of publicly criticizing their records on human rights. Such visits under Obama usually included addressing rights concerns, the Democratic president’s former aides said. McMaster insisted that Trump preferred to deal with such issues “quietly in every relationship.” One closely watched meeting will be with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte. Trump praised him in a phone call in April for a bloody anti-drugs campaign. An administration official told reporters human rights would be part of their “frank and friendly discussions.” But the government in Manila has been feeling less heat from the Trump administration about extrajudicial killings linked to drugs crackdown, according to a foreign ministry official. “It’s a very different White House under President Donald Trump, not like under President Barack Obama, who pushed human rights hard during his term,” the official told Reuters. “We are not hearing this from the White House.”   Another issue expected to be front and center is Myanmar’s Rohingya crisis. Trump’s critics, including Democratic lawmakers, have chided the administration for what they have seen as a halting response. U.S. officials have been reluctant to label the situation as “ethnic cleansing” even though the United Nations has used the term. Myanmar rejects that accusation, saying  action was needed to combat terrorism. Two months after an outbreak of violence that sent more than half a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing into Bangladesh, Washington has now sent a senior delegation, announced a planned visit by Tillerson on Nov. 15, and is threatening modest sanctions. When Kem Ley, a popular Cambodian political commentator, was killed by a gunman in July 2016, Malinowski, the State Department official, flew to Phnom Penh just days later and met top aides to Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has ruled for more than three decades. Malinowski’s stern words helped give local diplomats leverage to press rights concerns behind the scenes, said one U.S. official involved in Southeast Asia diplomacy. This year Hun Sen has intensified his crackdown, including the arrest of opposition leader Kem Sokha, while also stepping up rhetoric against Washington.  The State Department has largely limited its response to statements of “deep concern.” Cambodian government spokesman Phay Siphan said Cambodia had not felt pressure from Washington and Trump was clearly taking a different approach than Obama. “Their tone is lighter. Before, they would bully,” said ruling party parliamentarian Sok Eysan. The change under Trump, he added, “means we are on the right path towards democracy,” an assertion that contradicts human rights advocates who say the political climate has deteriorated. In Vietnam, dissident Nguyen Quang A expressed pessimism about Trump’s visit. Nguyen, who was detained by authorities on his way to meet Obama during a visit last year, said: “I don’t think Trump will talk about human rights. Just look at his words and actions.” The White House has not signaled that Trump plans to meet any dissidents during his Asia trip, something Obama frequently did in his foreign travels. There has been frustration among some U.S. diplomats in Beijing over perceptions that botched messaging from the United States signaled a retreat on human rights. But some U.S. officials said that behind the scenes the administration has been supportive of work in China on behalf of Chinese dissidents. A Beijing-based diplomat from another Western country said, however, that U.S. participation in meetings between Western allies to coordinate strategy on human rights was much reduced, for example, when it came to putting out joint statements on issues of concern. China has been “relieved” to see Trump giving human rights less weight, according to a Chinese diplomat in Washington. But Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said: “As for human rights, we are always willing to have constructive dialogue with countries of the world on the basis of mutual respect.” ","With 'America First,' Trump mutes U.S. voice on human rights in Asia"
0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States has circulated a draft U.N. Security Council resolution that would extend by two years the mandate of an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in Syria, after Russia vetoed an extension last week. The U.S. draft, which was seen by Reuters on Thursday, says Syria must not develop or produce chemical weapons, and it calls on all parties in Syria to provide full cooperation with the international probe. The investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons - known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) - was unanimously created by the 15-member Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November. The JIM found that the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad was to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people in April, according to a report sent to the Security Council on Oct. 26. Two days earlier, Russia vetoed a renewal of the JIM mandate after it was unsuccessful in getting the Security Council to postpone the vote. U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said Russia wanted to discuss the Khan Sheikhoun report before the vote. Russia, whose air force and special forces have been supporting the Syrian army, says there is no evidence to show Damascus was responsible for the attack. It maintains that the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels, not Assad’s government. [nL8N1N86I0] On Wednesday, the United States admonished Russia for its veto. [nL2N1N805Y] “Russia’s attempts to undermine and eliminate the JIM show a callous disregard for the suffering and loss of life caused by the use of chemical weapons and an utter lack of respect for international norms,” the White House said in a statement.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson by phone on Thursday it was unacceptable to politicize the work of chemical weapons inspectors in Syria, Russia’s foreign ministry said. [nL8N1MP0GI] A Russian draft resolution calls for a six-month extension of the inquiry, with the possibility of further extensions, and asks for investigators to collect environmental samples in connection with the Khan Sheikhoun probe, among other things. In their 14th report since 2011, U.N. investigators said in September they had documented 33 chemical weapons attacks to date. [nL8N1LN29P] Twenty-seven were by the Assad government, including seven between March 1 and July 7. Perpetrators had not been identified yet in six attacks, they said. The Assad government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons. It said its strikes in Khan Sheikhoun hit a weapons depot belonging to rebel forces, an assertion “excluded” by U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria Chairman Paulo Pinheiro. That attack led U.S. President Donald Trump to launch the first U.S. air strikes on a Syrian air base.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday released details of a 429-page tax bill that calls for slashing taxes on corporations, along with many other changes affecting individuals, families and businesses. Based on publicly released documents and comments from Republican lawmakers, here are the bill’s main features, which are expected to change as the tax debate unfolds in weeks ahead.  * Permanently reduces the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a current statutory rate of 35 percent, a change that is in line with initial Republican proposals.  * Dramatically reshapes the tax system for U.S. multinational corporations. Worldwide taxation of their foreign profits would end. A territorial tax system exempting those foreign profits from the corporate tax would be imposed.  * Gives multinationals a tax break on $2.6 trillion in profits they have stashed offshore on a tax-exempt basis. The measure would require those profits to be brought into the United States, or repatriated, but not at the full 35-percent corporate tax rate that would normally be due. Instead, those profits would be taxed at only 12 percent for cash assets and 5 percent for illiquid assets. Repatriation tax due under the proposal would be payable over eight years. * Imposes a new 10-percent minimum tax on U.S. companies’ high-profit foreign units, calculated on a global basis, to discourage shifting profits abroad.  * Proposes a tax on foreign companies operating in the United States of up to 20 percent on payments made abroad from U.S. operations. Companies could lower those taxes by putting more operations in the U.S. tax system. * Repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax.  ‘PASS-THROUGH’ BUSINESSES * Caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises to 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on “pass-through” income of 39.6 percent. * Sets standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. * Allows immediate and full expensing of capital investments by businesses. * Allows businesses to deduct interest costs up to 30 percent of taxable income. Exempts from this rule businesses with average gross receipts of $25 million or less. Certain public utilities and “real property trades” are also exempted. * Preserves the research and development tax credit. * Phases out tax credits for solar, geothermal and wind power. * Consolidates three higher education tax credits into a single credit. * Ends tax-exempt bonds for professional sports stadiums. * Ends deductions for employee entertainment and recreation activities, as well as other fringe benefits. * Consolidates the number of tax brackets from seven to the following: zero tax on income up to $24,000; 12 percent up to $90,000; 25 percent up to $260,000; 35 percent up to $1 million; and 39.6 percent over $1 million. That top bracket is the same as the present level and was added to the bill after critics hammered Republicans’ original proposal to cut the top rate. * Increases the standard deduction for taxpayers to $12,000 from $6,350 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,700 for married couples. * Repeals the $4,050 individual personal exemption. * Preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages, but reduces the amount of interest that taxpayers can deduct from their taxes on new mortgages, capping it at $500,000. The cap is now $1 million. * Caps the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. Repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, a measure that hurts high-income tax states, such as New York, New Jersey and California. * Retains popular retirement savings programs including the 401(k) and IRA pension plans. * Expands the child tax credit to $1,600 from $1,000, and establishes a new $300 credit for each parent and non-child dependent. Also preserves the child and dependent care tax credit. * Preserves the earned income tax credit. * Preserves the deduction for charitable giving. * Changes higher education benefits, such as college tuition, with further details not immediately available. * Repeals the individual alternative minimum tax on high-income taxpayers. * Doubles the exemption from the estate tax on inherited assets and repeals the tax over six years. * Adds $1.51 trillion to the federal budget deficit over a decade. The deficit is now about $700 billion a year. The national debt now exceeds $20 trillion. ","Factbox: What's in tax bill from Trump, House Republicans?"
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican tax plan unveiled on Thursday stirred anger at U.S. universities, which said its proposals to tax endowments of private institutions and repeal a deduction for student-loan interest payments would hurt institutions and students. The bill in the Republican-led House of Representatives would increase students’ cost of attending college by more than $65 billion between 2018 and 2027, according to an analysis by the American Council on Education (ACE), the lead lobby group for higher education. The plan “would discourage participation in postsecondary education, make college more expensive for those who do enroll, and undermine the financial stability of public and private, two-year and four-year colleges and universities,” ACE President Ted Mitchell said . House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most powerful Republican in Congress, told a news conference the tax plan would allow the typical family of four to save around $1,182 a year, which could go toward college savings. The plan would establish a 1.4 percent tax on the earnings of large, private-school endowments. It would also scrap a deduction for interest paid on student loans, which congressional analysts said would increase federal revenues by $47.5 billion over 10 years, if other smaller tuition-related tax breaks also end. President Donald Trump and fellow Republicans have locked horns with colleges and universities, which they say force liberal values on students. Private college endowments total $350 billion, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers (NACUBO). The tax would only apply to endowments with at least $100,000 in assets for each student enrolled. Since most universities must balance their budgets, they may raise tuition or cut programs and financial aid in order to cover a new tax, said NACUBO Federal Affairs Director Liz Clark. Princeton University uses earnings from its $22 billion endowment to provide aid to more than 60 percent of students  and pay for academic programs, facilities and research, said Bob Durkee, vice president and secretary at the New Jersey school.  Families with incomes below $160,000 pay no tuition, he said. Those with incomes less than $56,000 also forgo paying room and board. Ending the interest deduction would hurt people’s ability to afford an education, said Justin Draeger, president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators.  “For us, it’s one thing to talk about whether these funds are the most effective use of government money to help people afford college,” he said. “But it’s another to use them as an offset in an unclear tax overhaul.”  ",Republican tax plan would deal financial hit to U.S. universities
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. House Republican tax bill released on Thursday would put an end to tax-exempt debt issuance by state and local governments for an array of health care, education, and economic development financing, which took municipal market participants by surprise.  The proposed elimination of low-cost funding through private activity bonds, which many in the $3.8 trillion U.S. municipal market were not expecting, would raise nearly $39 billion for the federal government over the next nine years, according to a summary of the legislation. “This came as quite a shock,” said Barbara Thompson, executive director of the National Council of State Housing Agencies, noting that there had been assurances from Congress that private activity bond issuance would be retained. Thompson said it would be devastating for the country’s production of affordable housing. “The bill will increase borrowing costs and harm the ability of state and local governments to build and to maintain the infrastructure,” needed for critical health, education, ports, airports, and low-income housing, Sandy MacLennan, president of the National Association of Bond Lawyers, said in a statement.    Non-profit hospitals, which are major issuers of tax-free bonds to fund capital projects, would also be hit.  “For many communities, tax-exempt financing, such as private activity bonds, has been a key to maintaining vital hospital services,” Tom Nickels, executive vice president of the American Hospital Association, said in a statement.  “If hospital access to tax-exempt financing is limited or eliminated, hospitals’ ability to make investments in new technologies and renovations in the future will be challenged.”  Also on the chopping block are advance refunding bonds, which issuers in the U.S. municipal bond market use to take advantage of lower interest rates before outstanding bonds can be called.  “Current-law advance refunding bonds provide state and local governments with incentives to issue two sets of federally subsidized debt to finance the same activity,” the House bill’s summary stated. Tax-credit bonds, which never really caught on with investors, would be repealed but federal tax credits for existing bonds would remain in place. Bonds issued for professional sports facilities would be subject to federal taxation under the bill. The Alternative Minimum Tax would end under the legislation. That tax is applied to earnings from a small percentage of muni bonds sold by issuers such as airports and housing authorities that have substantial private-activity components in their deals. The proposals are not a sure thing. The bill has a long legislative process ahead with changes expected before it could be voted into law. Bill Gale, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said the likelihood of the final bill including the elimination of private activity bonds was “not high.” “It is hard to get support. There are an enormous number of revenue raisers in here and every one of them is politically going to be hard,” Gale said. ",Republican tax bill seeks elimination of some municipal debt
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. money managers with reinsurance companies in Bermuda and the Cayman Islands could lose a valuable loophole under Republican proposals to overhaul the tax code unveiled on Thursday.    The plan includes a 20 percent excise payment on payments from domestic firms to foreign affiliates that could affect private equity firms and hedge funds that have overseas reinsurance operations. The proposal would effectively kill the so-called Bermuda reinsurance loophole under which money managers are able to invest the premiums they raise as reinsurers in their funds without paying any tax on the gains. The plan is part of a 429-page bill that would represent the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s, and many analysts have raised doubts about the likelihood of it being passed. [nL2N1N80E2] “Our base call is that this tax package will fail. That would remove the immediate threat to the Bermuda reinsurance loophole,” said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen Washington Research Group.     “We cannot, however, say there is no risk here. This is because we do expect a smaller bill that deficit-finances temporary tax cuts that extend through the next presidential election. It is possible that there could be a few revenue offsets in that bill.” Shares in private equity firm Apollo (APO.N) ended down 3 percent on Thursday while its Bermuda-based division Athene Holding (ATH.N) closed nearly 7 percent weaker. Athene reinsures retirement savings products for people and institutions and has helped drive profits at Apollo.  Third Point Re (TPRE.N), the Bermuda-based reinsurance arm of hedge fund Third Point, finished 0.6 percent weaker while Greenlight Re (GLRE.O), a Caymans reinsurer run by hedge fund Greenlight ended down 0.23 percent.     Representatives of Greenlight and Third Point were not immediately available to comment. Included in the draft is also a proposal that would exclude non-traditional insurers based overseas, including hedge funds and other investors, from qualifying for favorable tax rates if certain insurance-related assets, such as some types of reserves and unearned premiums, represent less than 25 percent of their business. “The threshold in the bill is too high,” said Bradley Kading, president and executive director of the Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers. “These alternative capital vehicles took real losses from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria,” Kading said.

0,True,"November 3, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Some wealthy owners of U.S. major-league sports teams may have to put up more of their own money to fund stadium construction under a tax bill proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Republicans, but the overall impact could be slight, sports economists said. The legislation unveiled on Thursday could mean just a modest scaling-back of grand plans for new stadiums, with one expert suggesting team owners could help offset any lost federal subsidies, for example, by pouring concrete flooring instead of terrazzo.  Outside some of the biggest cities, team owners may have enough leverage to compel local governments hungry for the prestige and perceived economic benefits of new stadiums to come up with alternative funding streams. Various sports owners in the past have relocated teams to other cities because of stadium funding issues or used the threat of a move to extract concessions from local governments. “I’m sure the teams will be in a lather but, based on experience, if the cities/counties/states want to subsidize the stadium they’ll figure out some way,” Rick Eckstein, a sociology professor at Pennsylvania’s Villanova University, wrote in an email.   Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Massachusetts’s Smith College, said it may make future plans for billion-dollar stadiums “less elaborate,” but added it was nothing that team owners and local governments could not take in their stride. Under the Republican plan, local governments could no longer fund the building or renovating of professional sports stadiums by issuing tax-exempt public-purpose bonds, the sort of bonds typically used to fund things like schools, libraries and public transit.   U.S. President Donald Trump has called for an end to the subsidy, at least for the National Football League after some of its players angered the Republican president by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial bias in the criminal justice system. His Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, also proposed ending the tax break for stadiums in 2015. A report last year by the Brookings Institution, the Washington-based social sciences research group, found that of the 45 major-league stadiums built or overhauled since 2000, 36 were at least partly funded by tax-exempt municipal bonds.  The total tax-exempt bond principal issued to fund those stadiums was about $13 billion and led to a federal tax revenue loss of about $3.7 billion, the study found. Republicans say they would expect to see only an additional $200 million in tax revenue over the ensuing decade if the plan becomes law. Ted Gayer, one of the authors of the Brookings study, welcomed the proposal to end what he called an “egregious but small misuse of federal tax dollars.”  “Will it substantially affect the lucrative business of professional sports teams? No,” he said. “Will it substantially impact the ability of sports teams to get subsidies? No, maybe at the margins, but probably not.”  ",Republican tax plan may mean slightly less grand sports stadiums

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday ordered President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort to remain under home arrest and wear an electronic monitoring device for now as he awaits a tentative trial date on money-laundering and other charges. Manafort, who ran Trump’s presidential campaign for several months last year, and his associate Richard Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment. The charges include conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. They are part of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation of alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump’s associates.     The investigation has cast a shadow over the first nine months of the Republican’s presidency. Another top Trump former campaign advisor, Sam Clovis, withdrew his candidacy for an administration job, apparently as a result of Mueller’s probe. For Manafort and Gates, a conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  Both men appeared in court in Washington on Thursday. U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson said initial bail terms for the pair would remain in place for now, and set a bail hearing for Monday to consider changes.  Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, under unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million respectively, which means they do not have to post the bail unless they fail to show up for court or violate other conditions. Prosecutors have argued there is a risk the men would flee. They are also subject to electronic monitoring.     Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing, argued that while his client is willing to comply with a daily curfew, he would like to have the GPS monitoring lifted.  Jackson expressed reservations about the idea, saying she would “need to see some good reasons” and that he must articulate those in writing. “I am concerned - very concerned ... that an unsecured appearance bond in and of itself is not sufficient” without some sort of monitoring, she said. “If they leave and don’t come back, we need to know where they went.”       In a filing with the court, Downing said the government’s case against his client is flimsy and that the bail conditions should be softened because Manafort does not pose a flight risk. Gates’ attorneys made a similar request. Manafort and Gates remained quiet throughout the proceeding.         Jackson set a bail hearing for Monday morning, and said she would aim to set a tentative trial date next week.         She sharply warned lawyers for the duo about speaking about their case outside of court. “This is a criminal trial and not a public relations campaign,” Jackson said during a hearing. “I expect counsel to do their talking in the courtroom and in their pleadings, and not on the courthouse steps.” Mueller’s team is probing allegations that Russia interfered in the election to undercut Americans’ faith in their democracy,    damage Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and help Trump.  The inquiry also is meant to determine whether there was any coordination between Russians and associates of the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling. Trump has denied collusion between his associates and Russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt. Trump had nominated Clovis, his campaign’s national co-chairman, to a post as chief scientist at the Department of Agriculture. In a letter to Trump describing his decision to withdraw from consideration, Clovis made no mention of the Russia controversy, but cited “the political climate inside Washington.” “The relentless assaults on you and your team seem to be a blood sport that only increases in intensity each day,” Clovis wrote in the letter. “As I am focused on your success and the success of this Administration, I do not want to be a distraction or negative influence.” A source familiar with Mueller’s investigation identified Clovis as the unnamed campaign supervisor in a court filing who had discussions with Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos about efforts to improve U.S.-Russian relations and setting up meetings between senior Trump campaign and Russian officials. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about his dealings with Russians. Clovis has not been charged with wrongdoing. “Mr. Clovis’ nomination was only withdrawn because that would certainly have been a topic during his upcoming testimony, under oath, before the Senate Agriculture Committee,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, a member of the committee, said. “I know because I was going ask him all about it to get more facts on the record and before the American people.”     ",U.S. judge orders former Trump aides to stay under home arrest
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Democrats on Thursday demanded that Attorney General Jeff Sessions be recalled to testify on the Trump campaign’s Russia contacts after the disclosure of an effort to set up a meeting between then-Republican candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Judiciary Committee Democrats want to question Sessions, who was the Trump campaign’s chief foreign policy adviser, about his denials that he knew anything about contacts between the campaign and Russians or Russian government intermediaries. Sessions “needs to come back before the committee, in person, under oath, to explain why he cannot seem to provide truthful, complete answers,” Senator Patrick Leahy, the panel’s senior Democrat, said in a statement. Two other Democrats supported Leahy’s call “Attorney General Sessions should come back before Congress and answer questions in light of recent revelations,” said Senator Ron Wyden. In an eight-page letter to Sessions on Thursday, Senator Al Franken recalled that the attorney general said at an Oct. 18 Judiciary Committee hearing that a continuing exchange between the Trump campaign and Russian government intermediaries “did not happen, at least not to my knowledge and not with me.” Sessions, Franken wrote, “apparently failed to tell the truth under oath.”     According to court documents filed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that were unsealed on Monday, George Papadopoulos, a minor Trump campaign adviser, said at a March 31, 2016, meeting of Trump foreign policy advisers “that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then-candidate Trump and President Putin.”     A photograph posted on Trump’s Instagram account shows Papadopoulos sitting two seats from Sessions at the meeting, which Trump also attended. A New York Times report on Tuesday quoted a participant as saying that Sessions “shut George down,” ruled there should be no meeting with Putin and ordered those present “not to speak about this again.”     However, CNN reported on Thursday that John Cornyn, the second-ranking Senate Republican, who serves on the intelligence and judiciary committees, said that he had been unaware that Sessions was at the meeting. “I certainly think it’s a legitimate area of inquiry” for congressional investigators to pursue, Cornyn told CNN. CNN also reported that Carter Page, another former Trump campaign adviser, told the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday that he had informed Sessions of an upcoming July 2016 trip to Russia. Page said the trip was unrelated to his work for the Trump campaign, CNN said. Democratic sources who requested anonymity said Republican Chuck Grassley, the committee chairman, is resisting the Democrats’ demands to recall Sessions. Instead, he is suggesting that the attorney general be allowed to submit updated written testimony, they said. A spokesman for Grassley did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment, and Trump denies any collusion.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday agreed to expand the use of disaster aid to help rebuild Puerto Rico’s power grid and other infrastructure wrecked by Hurricane Maria, the White House said. In a unique agreement recognizing both the massive devastation on the island and its dire financial problems, aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for infrastructure projects will be released in a faster, more flexible way than is typical after disasters, a senior White House official told Reuters. The plan, agreed to with Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello, will also provide for third-party advisers to estimate how much money is requires for big-ticket projects, and how it is spent - a provision aimed at protecting taxpayer dollars in what is expected to be a massive, long-term effort to rebuild the island. “We’re doing it in a way that grants flexibility, but also imposes a mutually agreed upon set of controls,” the official said in an interview. The new agreement will see FEMA cover 90 percent of the costs for rebuilding public infrastructure, up from the typical level of 75 percent. Puerto Rico - home to 3.4 million Americans - is in bankruptcy, struggling with $72 billion in debt. Its finances were put under federal control last year. Six weeks after Hurricane Maria hit, only about 30 percent of Puerto Rico’s power grid has been restored. Private sector estimates of total damage from Maria have ranged as high as $95 billion. The White House is expected to deliver a new request for disaster aid to the U.S. Congress in mid-November to help defray costs from Maria and two other major hurricanes - Harvey and Irma - as well as damage caused by wildfires in the western United States. It is not yet clear how big the federal tab for Puerto Rico will be. “Obviously it’s going to be a big dollar figure,” the official said. “I know there won’t be any balking at the amount of money needed from the administration.” Even with FEMA covering 90 percent of the costs, it could be difficult for the territorial government to put up its 10 percent. On top of its fiscal constraints, the storm has ground its economy - and tax revenues - to a halt. The federal government provided a $150 million loan in an aid package approved by Congress last month that can be used to help cover its share, the official said.         “We didn’t want to create the precedent of giving 100 percent in the grant program and then disincentivizing good stewardship,” the official said. The federal government will also use relatively new procedures created in 2013 after Hurricane Sandy known as “Section 428” in the Stafford Act, the law that provides for federal disaster aid. “It’s not been used on this scale before,” the official said. The procedures will allow Puerto Rico to estimate the costs of big projects up front - with help from third-party advisers - and draw down from approved grants, eliminating the slow and cumbersome process of being reimbursed for upfront spending on each segment. The agreement will also allow Puerto Rico to access hazard mitigation grants - normally tapped only outside of disasters - while rebuilding the creaky power grid and other infrastructure so that the structures are more resilient to future hurricanes. “We’re going to build them back smarter,” the official said.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. religious entities would be allowed to engage in political activity without the risk of losing their tax-exempt status under a Republican proposal to overhaul the tax code unveiled on Thursday, a move that could give influential community leaders more latitude to try to influence voters. The plan would eliminate a provision in the tax code known as the “Johnson Amendment,” which prohibits churches from using church resources to encourage voting for or against a candidate.  A religious leader can currently endorse a candidate in their personal capacity, but they cannot do so within the confines of their church, mosque or synagogue or use their staff to help a candidate.      Supporters say it will increase religious liberty. Opponents say it will allow political leaders to pressure churches and allow some churches to be turned into political operations. The change would apply to all religious groups that register as non-profits, including places of worship for Christians, Muslims and Jews.  But it is evangelical Christians - who have become increasingly more engaged in the political process in the past 25 years - who have clamored the most loudly for the change.  President Donald Trump, who is popular with evangelical voters, vowed on the campaign trail to scrap the Johnson Amendment, arguing that it kept evangelical churches from helping his campaign.  Critics of the Johnson Amendment have long argued that it violates the First Amendment’s separation of church and state because it imposes restrictions on what religious leaders can say. But supporters of the Johnson Amendment say it does just the opposite and instead protects the separation of church and state, arguing that it will allow political leaders to pressure churches to give them endorsements. The announced change was part of a proposed cut in the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent is the centerpiece of the tax proposal unveiled by House of Representatives Republicans. The plan would also reduce tax rates on some individuals and families.  Many analysts have raised doubts about the likelihood that Congress will be able to pass a comprehensive tax package, including whether they will have enough support for several provisions including the change in religious rules. Allowing churches to engage in political activity might provide some tactical help for Republicans in the 2018 U.S. congressional elections. Republicans have long argued that the Johnson Amendment places them at a disadvantage because churches are a central organizing mechanism for their voters while labor unions, which favor Democrats, are allowed to engage in political activity and operate as tax-exempt.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a candidate, U.S. President Donald Trump promised to close the “carried interest” tax break that benefits some of Wall Street’s wealthiest financiers - but the Republican tax bill released on Thursday makes no mention of it. Carried interest is a share of an investment fund’s profits - typically about 20 percent beyond the return guaranteed to investors - that is paid out to the general partners of private equity, venture capital, real estate and hedge funds. Under current law, carried interest income is taxed at the capital gains rate of 20 percent. That is well below the 39.6 percent rate that high earners pay on ordinary wages and salary.  Trump pledged during his populist presidential campaign to close the carried-interest loophole, saying hedge fund managers were “paper pushers” who were “getting away with murder.” Carried interest represents a large portion of many fund managers’ incomes. For years they have employed Washington lobbyists to help defend the lucrative tax break. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in August that the Trump administration still planned to close the loophole for hedge funds, but there might be an exemption to allow financial firms that “create jobs” to continue taking advantage of the tax break. The 429-page tax bill released by Republicans in the House of Representatives on Thursday has no language changing how financial firms can take advantage of the lower carried-interest rate. “The introduced text does not modify current policy related to carried interest,” a spokesman for the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee said. The bill is expected to undergo revisions before it is brought up for a vote in the House. Trump has said he would like to see the House and the Senate pass tax legislation before the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. “We fully expected months ago that the one thing that they would do to close loopholes would be the one thing that Trump talked about during the campaign,” said Seth Hanlon, a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress and a former economic adviser to Democratic President Barack Obama. Obama targeted the carried interest loophole but never closed it. Government estimates show it will cost the federal budget at least $20 billion over the next decade.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A Republican tax bill unveiled on Thursday included cuts to renewable energy tax credits considered critical to enabling wind projects to compete with fossil fuel plants, but tax breaks for solar power were left largely intact. The credits, which receive broad bipartisan support, were extended by Congress less than two years ago. The wind industry decried the proposal, saying it put $50 billion in planned investment at risk, while the solar sector expressed relief the bill mostly preserved the timeline laid out in 2015 for its primary tax credit. In the same legislation, Republicans proposed eliminating the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles. Greg Wetstone, president of the non-profit American Council on Renewable Energy, said the move was “mystifying.” “Wind has particularly been a boon in rural areas where there aren’t a lot of economic choices,” Wetstone said, noting that wind had strong support in the Senate, which has yet to weigh in on the bill. Of major concern to wind developers, the legislation called for a reduced credit for every kilowatt-hour of energy produced from wind projects.  In 2015 and 2016, the credit was worth 2.4 cents, dropping by 20 percent each year for projects that start construction from 2017 through 2019. In the proposed bill, that credit would drop to 1.5 cents per kwh. In addition, projects must show that there is continuous construction in order to claim the tax credit available on the day construction starts.  The provision would increase tax revenue by $12.3 billion from 2018 to 2027, according to the bill summary. In a statement, the American Wind Energy Association trade group said investors and project developers had banked on the stability of the policy enacted in 2015 in planning billions of dollars of investment in wind energy. “The House proposal would pull the rug out from under 100,000 U.S. wind workers and 500 American factories,” AWEA Chief Executive Tom Kiernan said in a statement. The solar industry’s main trade group, the Solar Energy Industries Association, said it was encouraged that a tax credit worth 30 percent of the value of a solar project had been left mostly intact. Under current law, that credit is scheduled to step down in value gradually until 2022, when it becomes a permanent 10 percent credit only for utility and commercial projects. The bill unveiled on Thursday would eliminate the 10 percent tax credit, but not until after 2027. ","Republican tax bill hits wind power, solar largely unscathed"
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Jerome Powell was not on President Donald Trump’s early radar as a possible successor to Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, and was angling instead for a job as the U.S. central bank’s vice chair for supervision. But when he was passed over for that position last summer, it was one in a chain of events that set the stage for the 64-year-old Fed governor and former investment banker to take over as head of the world’s most powerful central bank. Trump on Thursday nominated Powell to replace Yellen when her term expires in early February, saying at the White House that the 64-year-old lawyer and former investment banker has the necessary “wisdom and leadership.”[nL2N1N80D3]  Other contenders for the job fell for different reasons, as Trump soured on top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn, decided against renominating Yellen despite largely approving of her policies and came to view two others as posing risks to the economy, according to current and former Fed and government officials familiar with the decision.  In the end it was Powell, a Maryland native, avid cyclist, and guitar hobbyist, who checked all the boxes that mattered but carried none of the negatives.  If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Powell would become the first person without an advanced economics degree to hold the job since William Miller in the late 1970s. Powell, who lists personal assets of between $20 million and $60 million on government disclosure forms, has served on corporate boards as a managing partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. But he has also burrowed deep over the last five years into the nuts and bolts of central banking, and schooled himself on broader monetary policy issues.    “Jay does not come with baggage... He has never been at the extremes,” said Steve Bell, who worked with Powell at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank and when Powell was at the Treasury Department in former President George H.W. Bush’s administration. When compared to other possible nominees, some of whom called for sweeping but ill-defined changes at the Fed, Powell took “a straight tactical line” that offered a continuation of Yellen’s policies, a moderate approach to bank regulation and, perhaps most importantly, the prospect of no surprises, Bell said. Powell’s private-sector background appealed as well to Trump’s preference for business figures over those with Phds. A senior White House official on Thursday called his experience “unique” and “refreshing” at a central bank increasingly dominated by economists.  Stanford University economist John Taylor, who developed the “Taylor Rule” for guiding monetary policy, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh, who resigned over the central bank’s massive bond-buying stimulus program credited by many with spurring the U.S. economy after the 2007-2009 recession, were also interviewed for the Fed job. They arguably had a head start, the backing of conservatives, and steady support from the Wall Street Journal’s influential editorial board.  But they also carried the risk of financial market volatility, with investors regarding each as somebody who could tighten monetary policy at the central bank. That is something Trump has indicated he wants to avoid. The first two names Trump floated were Yellen and Cohn. But Cohn fell out of favor after he criticized Trump’s response to violence sparked by a white supremacist rally in Virginia in August. A former Fed official, contacted over the summer as part of the White House’s Fed chief search, said it was clear the administration wasn’t interested, for example, in Taylor and his reliance on “rules” that generally call for interest rates to be higher than they currently are. The administration officials vetting Fed candidates were “very much opposed to Taylor-type rules and systematic policy,” said the former official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Warsh, meanwhile, became the target of an aggressive grassroots campaign that highlighted what some critics viewed as a history of bad calls on inflation during his tenure as a Fed policymaker, portending a tough confirmation fight. Powell also benefited from burgeoning relationships through his work on the technical aspects of markets, and his assumption of the role as the Fed’s regulatory point person after the resignation of former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo in April. That prompted Powell to initially set his sights on the job of vice chair for supervision, though it soon became clear he would not get it, according to a person who had discussions with White House and Fed officials involved in the process.  Yet Powell’s close work with the Treasury resulted in Secretary Steven Mnuchin becoming a strong advocate of his nomination to the top job, Fed and government officials said on condition of anonymity. Fed Governor Randal Quarles, a friend and colleague who got the vice chair job that Powell had wanted, was an additional ally in the mix. But it was Powell’s support of the Yellen Fed’s policies, often credited with paving the way for a 4.2 percent unemployment rate, steady economic growth and calm markets, that may have been his strongest advantage in the race.  “Trump is savvy enough to look at the numbers and who is in the chair,” said Peter Conti-Brown, an assistant professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. Powell solves the problem of a Republican administration that wants “the Yellen Fed without Yellen,” Conti-Brown said. ","Powell rose to top of Trump's list as safe, savvy choice for Fed"
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. Powell, 64, a lawyer and investment banker appointed to the Fed board in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama, emerged as Trump’s choice from a slate of possible nominees that included Yellen and others who may have pursued a sharp policy shift. In an announcement at the White House, Trump described the soft-spoken Powell as a smart and committed leader who would build on Yellen’s achievements in steering the U.S. economy after the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. “If we are to sustain all this progress, our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight,” Trump said as Powell looked on. “We need strong and steady leadership at the U.S. Federal Reserve ... He will provide exactly that.”   Powell has worked alongside Yellen for the past five years, backing her direction on monetary policy and, in recent years, sharing her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates. Yellen’s four-year term as Fed chief ends in early February 2018. She will be the first U.S. central bank chief not to be renominated to a second term since 1979. Trump on Thursday lauded Yellen’s stewardship but did not say why he decided to pass her over for another term. The Republican president said he was impressed by Powell’s experience in the private-sector and “real-world perspective” to government.  “He understands what it takes for our economy to grow,” Trump said. Powell, who in the last 25 years has done a prototypical Washington circuit of government, private, and think tank jobs, pledged to be attuned to emerging financial risks and the impact the Fed has on average Americans. He will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and one that boasts an unemployment rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low.  “Monetary policy decisions matter for American families and communities. I strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence,” Powell said in brief remarks after Trump’s announcement. His nomination now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate for confirmation. “I’m encouraged by President Trump’s choice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that pledged “timely” consideration of the nomination. There was little apparent market reaction to Powell’s nomination, which had been expected. Investors were largely focused on the release of details of a Republican plan to broadly change the U.S. tax code. By setting benchmark short-term interest rates, the Fed broadly influences borrowing and lending conditions in the economy. Since the crisis, the central bank has gained more power over the financial sector, while becoming more concerned about issues like income inequality. Yellen, a Fed veteran who has served at all levels of the sprawling central bank system, said in a written statement that she would work with Powell “to ensure a smooth transition.” Trump’s decision, after a broad and very public search, offers what analysts said was a classic compromise, allowing him to select his own Fed chief while getting continuity with the policies of the Yellen-run central bank. “The kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting Powell, (Trump) has all but selected Yellen,” said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and author of a recent book on Fed politics. “There is not really much daylight, if any.” In June, Powell laid out both a defense of the Fed’s gradualist path and a critique of those, including some of his competitors for the Fed job, who argued the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems. Trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low, a position apparently at odds with some of those who were on his short list, particularly Stanford University economist John Taylor and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn also was a contender. Powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by Yellen on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and U.S. stock markets near record highs. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month. But Powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the crisis, also important to Trump. Powell can now pursue that end along with Trump appointee Randal Quarles, the Fed’s new vice chair for supervision. Though he will be the first Fed chief since the late 1970s  without an advanced degree in economics, Powell brings market insights, Fed board experience and Republican ties that analysts say will likely make for a smooth confirmation and transition. Under President George H.W. Bush, Powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the Treasury. From 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, and focused on public debt dynamics while at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. Yellen is entitled to remain as a Fed governor until 2024, though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump supports the tax overhaul bill unveiled on Thursday by Republicans in the House of Representatives, a top White House advisor said. “The bill that the House has delivered today ... is a bill that the president can support,” National Economic Council director Gary Cohn told a gathering of the Economic Club of Washington, adding that he was confident the House would approve a tax overhaul.  “If it delivers middle class tax relief and a 20 percent corporate tax rate and it shows up on his desk I can guarantee he’s going to sign it,” Cohn said. Republicans pushing the tax bill will have to accept the assessments of budget analysts who may not share the White House’s views on how the tax bill could increase some tax revenues by fostering growth in the economy, Cohn said. “We have to accept the score to get the legislation through,” he said. “We will legislate to a bill to get the score that we need to get it through the legislative process.” ",Trump supports Republican tax overhaul bill: adviser
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, promoting a soft-spoken centrist to replace Janet Yellen when her term expires in February 2018. In five years as a Fed Governor Jerome Powell has been a consistent, middle of the road voice, backing the consensus crafted by Fed chair Janet Yellen that interest rates should be raised slowly so labor markets could recover, that financial stability risks were muted, and that new regulations had made the economy safer. Following is a collection of quotes from select policy speeches he has delivered since 2015: On Rates:  “The financial crisis did significant damage to the productive capacity of our economy, and the damage was of a character, extent, and duration that cannot be fully known today…It seems plausible that at least part of this supply-side damage could be reversed if the economy enjoys a period of sustained growth.4 To encourage that outcome, as monetary policymakers consider removing accommodation, we should look for a little more proof than usual that labor markets are tightening or other supply-side constraints are binding.” - April 2015 speech to New York Council on Foreign Relations: (Graphic: U.S. labor market measures vs interest rates - reut.rs/2h7hsFx) On Financial Stability:  “The bottom line is that there has not been an excessive buildup of leverage, maturity transformation, or broadly unsustainable asset prices…Overall, I do not see leveraged finance markets as posing undue financial stability risks. And if risk-taking does not threaten financial stability, it is not the Fed’s job to stop people from losing (or making) money.”  - January 2017 speech to American Finance Association, Chicago  (Graphic: U.S. stocks and leverage - reut.rs/2iolCp6) On Regulation: “We have substantially increased the capital, liquidity, and other prudential requirements for large banking firms. These measures are not free. Higher capital requirements increase bank costs, and at least some of those costs will be passed along to bank customers and shareholders. But in the longer term, stronger prudential requirements for large banking firms will produce more sustainable credit availability and economic growth.” - June 2017 speech to Salzburg Global Seminar, Salzburg, Austria (Graphic: Commercial credit and bank profitability - reut.rs/2h8lfCm) On the Current Economy: “Risks to the forecast now seem more balanced than they have been for some time. In particular, the global picture has brightened as growth and inflation have broadly moved up for the first time in several years. Here at home, risks seem both moderate and balanced, including the downside risk of lower inflation and the upside risk of labor market overheating. The Committee has been patient in raising rates, and that patience has paid dividends…. If the economy performs about as expected, I would view it as appropriate to continue to gradually raise rates.” - June 2017 speech to the Economic Club of New York (Graphic: The inflation conundrum - reut.rs/2za4ltY) Other issues may confront Powell in his confirmation hearings and as chair, such as whether to keep the current system of paying banks interest on their reserves as the main method of setting short term interest rates, and whether to rely on monetary policy rules: On Reserve Interest:   “Simple to operate and has provided good control over the federal funds rate.” - June 2017 speech to the Economic Club of New York (Graphic: Bank reserves at the Fed - reut.rs/2z7Qdl8) On Policy Rules:  “I am unable to think of any critical, complex human activity that could be safely reduced to a simple summary equation. In particular, no major central bank uses policy rules in a prescriptive way, and it is hard to predict the consequences of requiring the FOMC to do so, as some have proposed.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers proposed targeted sanctions and travel restrictions on Myanmar military officials on Thursday over the treatment of the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority, one of the strongest efforts yet for Washington to intervene in the humanitarian crisis. Introduced the day before Republican Donald Trump leaves on his first trip to Asia as president, the legislation would reimpose some sanctions lifted last year as Myanmar returned to democracy. It also would bar the United States from supplying most assistance to the country’s military until perpetrators of atrocities against the Rohingya are held accountable. The measure does not target Burmese leader Aung San Suu Kyi, head of Myanmar’s civilian-led government and a Nobel peace laureate who still enjoys strong support among some U.S. officials. But congressional aides said it is intended to underscore a strong desire among many members of Congress for her to do more to help the Rohingya. The legislation is sponsored by lawmakers including the Republican Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John McCain, and Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “This bill will allow Congress to strengthen the president’s hand by making it clear to Burmese officials that there will be consequences for their crimes against humanity,” Cardin said in a statement. Among other things, it re-imposes a ban on jade and rubies from Myanmar and requires a report on which individuals should be subjected to sanctions, and instructs the U.S. Treasury Department not to support international financial assistance programs that partner with enterprises owned by the Myanmar military. A companion bill is also being introduced in the House of Representatives. That measure is also bipartisan, led by Representative Eliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Republican Representative Steve Chabot, another foreign affairs panel member. Members of Congress have been clamoring for a strong response to the plight of the Rohingya, and the Trump administration has been weighing labeling their treatment “ethnic cleansing.”  The State Department announced on Thursday that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would accompany Trump on his trip to Asia, and also stop in Myanmar. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks in August with a crackdown that has included reports of burnt villages and widespread killings. The United Nations has denounced it as a classic example of ethnic cleansing. ",U.S. lawmakers target Myanmar military with new sanctions
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House Republicans are proposing to eliminate the $7,500 tax credit for electric vehicles, which could hurt automakers like General Motors Co, Tesla Inc and Nissan Motor Co, according to the bill made public on Thursday. Current law allows automakers to use the credit, which  phases out after an automaker hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold. Electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles. Environmental groups and an auto industry trade group blasted the proposal, which would kick in at the end of this year. GM vowed to fight, saying the credits are “an important customer benefit that can help accelerate the acceptance of electric vehicles.” Tesla declined to comment. Nissan said it supports continuing the tax credit and noted it has “made significant investments in the development of market-leading electric vehicles.” Critics of the credit say electric vehicle buyers tend to be wealthier than average and do not need subsidies. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, a trade group representing GM, Toyota Motor Corp, Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) and others, said the change could hurt electric vehicle sales. “The potential elimination of the federal electric vehicle tax credit will impact the choices of prospective buyers and make the electric vehicle mandate in 10 states - about a third of the market - even more difficult to meet,” Bergquist said. “The EV tax credit repeal would cede U.S. leadership in clean vehicles, putting our companies at a competitive disadvantage and threatening jobs while costing drivers more at the pump and increasing pollution,” said Luke Tonachel, director of the National Resources Defense Council’s Clean Vehicles and Fuels Project. Automakers have invested billions in electric vehicles and announced plans to shift significant production to plug-in models. Former President Barack Obama unsuccessfully proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate. GM shares fell 1.2 percent in late trading, while Tesla was down 7 percent after reporting earnings. The House GOP plan also calls for repealing and phasing out other energy tax credits, including production and investment tax credit for solar, geothermal, fuel cell, wind energy and other clean energy projects. Automakers face mandates from California and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements. GM’s electric Chevrolet Bolt starts around $30,000 including the tax credit but rises to $37,500 without it.  ","House Republicans propose to scrap $7,500 electric vehicle credit"

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional Democrats filed suit on Thursday seeking the release of government documents related to Republican President Donald Trump’s ownership of a Washington hotel that critics say represents a conflict of interest. In the lawsuit, Democrats on the House of Representatives’ Oversight and Government Reform Committee said the General Services Administration (GSA), the government’s property arm, illegally withheld documents about the Trump International Hotel. The 14-page suit marks the latest legal skirmish over the luxury hotel a few blocks from the White House, which has become a rallying point for anti-Trump protesters. Critics say the hotel violates government rules barring elected officials from taking part in a lease of federal property. Representative Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the committee’s ranking Democrat, said the GSA had ignored federal law by refusing to provide documents about the hotel’s operation, foreign payments to the hotel or the legal reasoning that Trump could be a party to the lease. “We have no transparency - no ability to check for ongoing conflicts of interest or unconstitutional foreign payments,” Cummings said in a statement. The suit filed in U.S. District Court names acting General Services Administrator Timothy Horne as defendant. Pam Dixon, a spokeswoman for the agency, said it would not comment on pending litigation. Cummings and other critics have argued that the hotel housed in the government’s historic Old Post Office represented a conflict of interest because Trump is both landlord and tenant of the building. A GSA contracting officer said in March that the hotel was not in violation of federal conflict-of-interest rules.  Thursday’s lawsuit said the GSA rebuffed three requests from committee Democrats for information about the hotel since Trump took office in January. The requests included ones filed under a law which mandates that a federal agency turn over information requested by at least seven members of the committee. Under the same law, the GSA had produced documents about the  Trump International Hotel while Democrat Barack Obama was president, the suit said. Trump is facing numerous lawsuits targeting his alleged failure to distance himself from his business empire while in office. The president ceded day-to-day control of his businesses to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr., in a move he said would steer clear of conflicts of interest.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Thursday accused technology companies of failing to adequately help federal investigators access encrypted communications, saying over the past year that the FBI was blocked from accessing nearly 7,500 mobile devices. Sessions criticized the technology sector in a speech in New York City, just two days after Sayfullo Saipov, an Uzbek immigrant, allegedly drove a truck down a lower Manhattan bike path, killing eight people and injuring 11. Saipov said he was inspired by Islamic State videos, according to investigators. Sessions, speaking at the U.S. attorney’s office not far from the site of the attack, addressed the tragedy by offering his condolences. He then laid out a three-point plan to combat terrorism more generally, which he said should include new immigration restrictions, improved access to electronic communications and continued efforts to “aggressively surveill non-citizen terrorists overseas.” “Terrorists should know: This administration will use all lawful tools at our disposal,” Sessions said, saying such tools will include using both federal courts and military proceedings at Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba to prosecute terrorism suspects.   “If anyone has any doubt about that, they can ask the more than 500 criminals whom the Department of Justice has convicted of terrorism-related offenses since 9/11, he said, referring to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. “And they can ask the dozens of enemy combatants in Guantanamo Bay.”  Sessions did not say whether he thought that Saipov should be sent to Guantanamo, though he did voice support for a proposal by President Donald Trump to scrap a diversity visa program and replace it with a merit-based system. On Wednesday, Trump said he would consider sending Saipov to a military prison at Guantanamo. No detainee has been sent to there since 2008. Sessions on Thursday also harshly criticized Silicon Valley, saying technology companies too often “refuse to cooperate with law enforcement or even to comply with court orders.”   As an example, he cited a 2015 terrorist incident in Garland, Texas, after two gunmen opened fired with assault rifles at an exhibit featuring caricatures of the Prophet Mohammed. Sessions said one of the terrorists had sent more than 100 instant messages to another terrorist overseas.  “What we don’t know, however, is what he said - because those messages are encrypted,” he said. The Justice Department in recent weeks has been signaling it plans to take a tougher stance with technology companies over accessing encrypted data. Last month, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein also discussed the topic, and suggested attempts to negotiate with the tech sector were a waste of time because they valued profit over stopping crime.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews," WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 12 he would stop subsidies to health insurers critical to the Obamacare law, the response from Democratic state officials was swift and predictable: a lawsuit by 18 state attorneys general was filed within 24 hours.  The race to the courthouse in response to presidential actions has become a familiar pattern since Trump took office in January, and early rulings in many of the lawsuits have, at least temporarily, hobbled key parts of the president’s agenda.  Many of the Republican president’s most significant executive actions, in areas from immigration and transgender rights to energy and the environment, have been impeded by court rulings in cases brought by Democratic state and local officials as well as liberal advocacy groups.  “We are more of a check on this administration than Congress,” Democratic New York state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said of state attorneys general.  Similarly, important executive actions taken by Trump’s Democratic predecessor Barack Obama were stymied by lawsuits filed by Republican state attorneys general, including one eventually decided by the Supreme Court that was intended to protect millions of immigrants in the country illegally from deportation.  Since Trump took office, courts have at least temporarily blocked Trump’s plans to:  **ban travelers and immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries  **withhold federal funds from so-called sanctuary cities that refuse to cooperate with federal authorities on immigration enforcement  **ban transgender people from serving in the military  **delay implementation of a regulation issued by the Obama administration limiting methane emissions  **put the brakes on an Interior Department rule requiring energy firms to pay more mineral royalties on federal land  **delay compliance with an Obama-era rule aimed at curbing natural gas drilling waste emissions on federal land  **and impede a detained illegal immigrant teenager from obtaining an abortion      Trump has claimed some court victories, too, including on Oct. 25 when a federal judge in California refused the request by the state attorneys general to force the government to keep the subsidies to insurers under Obamacare, formally known as the Affordable Care Act, in place as the litigation proceeds. That decision was more the exception than the rule.  ""President Trump remains committed to protecting our national security and to eliminating excessive regulations that, if implemented, would destroy jobs, harm consumers and provide no meaningful benefit,"" a White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said in a statement provided to Reuters. ""The Trump administration is confident in its legal positions and looks forward to arguing -- and winning -- before the federal judiciary,"" the official added.  In response to legal setbacks, Trump has lashed out at the judiciary in ways that even his own Supreme Court appointee Neil Gorsuch called disheartening and demoralizing. Trump called U.S. courts “so political,” labeled various rulings and proceedings “ridiculous” and “disgraceful,” and disparaged one jurist who ruled against him as a “so-called judge.”  While presidents often face legal challenges over policy initiatives, Trump’s administration stands out for the number of suits it has encountered so soon after taking power.   Trump has faced far more litigation than Obama had at this stage of his presidency. A review of legal database Westlaw showed that in Trump’s first nine months in office, cities or states filed 24 lawsuits challenging major policy initiatives of the administration. The review showed no similar lawsuits during the same time period of Obama’s presidency.  Trump also faces numerous suits by advocacy groups and others challenging such actions as his termination of an Obama program that protected people brought into the United States illegally as children from deportation and the authority of a presidential commission formed to investigate alleged voter fraud.  Trump has relied heavily on unilateral executive actions to advance his policy objectives. His fellow Republicans who control Congress have been unable to pass any major legislation he has sought.  Executive actions can be challenged in court more quickly than lengthy federal rule-making procedures, said law professor Jonathan Adler of Case Western Reserve University School of Law.  Obama relied on executive actions during the later years of his presidency after being unable to win congressional approval of key initiatives, and some of those actions drew legal challenges. But early in his presidency, he relied on unilateral actions less often because his fellow Democrats controlled Congress and passed major legislation including the 2010 Obamacare law.  Some legal experts say the haste with which Trump drafted some of his policy initiatives may have helped those challenging the actions because the orders were not sufficiently vetted.  “This administration is more willing to shoot from the hip” when compared with the Obama administration, Adler said.  That is how San Francisco City Attorney Dennis Herrera, a Democrat, saw Trump’s executive order on sanctuary city funding, which Herrera calculated could jeopardize up to $2 billion in federal funds for his city.  Herrera said he saw Trump’s action as “designed to appeal to a part of the administration’s political base without really having been vetted” by lawyers to ensure it was legally airtight. Herrera won an initial ruling in April blocking the measure, and the case is now pending before an appeals court.  Trump’s actions have appealed to his conservative political base, while the legal challenges have pleased his liberal critics.  Speaking at an event at New York University, Schneiderman, New York’s attorney general, called Trump’s first travel ban, signed in January just a week into his presidency, a “galvanizing moment” for Democratic officials.  While lawsuits challenging the president’s actions have won some important early victories, the litigation onslaught’s ultimate effect on Trump’s agenda is not yet clear.  Trump’s opponents have tended to file suits in jurisdictions where they think they are likely to prevail, and where appeals will be heard in regional federal circuit courts dominated by Democratic-appointed judges.  The final decisions on the cases could be made by the Supreme Court, where Trump’s appointment of Gorsuch restored a 5-4 conservative majority.  The high court is likely to “prove more receptive” to the administration’s arguments on issues like immigration, said George Washington University Law School professor Jonathan Turley.  Last week, a federal judge in San Francisco who was appointed by Obama appeared skeptical in a hearing about the challenge by the 18 states to the Affordable Care Act subsidies, illustrating the limits of resistance through litigation.  Alluding to the political aspect of the case, U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria asked rhetorically during a hearing: why “have all these attorneys general rushed to court seeking an emergency ruling against President Trump?” Chhabria then ruled in favor of Trump.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"FRONT ROYAL, Va. (Reuters) - Ralph and Mike Waller are such ardent backers of President Donald Trump that they help stage a counter-protest every Wednesday in front of their Front Royal, Virginia, pawn shop, sparring with anti-Trump demonstrators who gather across the street.  But ask them about Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for Virginia governor in next Tuesday’s election, and they show little enthusiasm.  “I would like somebody who’s more closely aligned with Trump,” Ralph Waller, who is Mike Waller’s uncle, said from the shop floor, racks of pawned rifles behind him.  Gillespie is, in fact, nothing like Trump, a real estate magnate who had never before held political office, although both are members of the same party. Gillespie is a Washington lobbyist who worked in President George W. Bush’s White House, the kind of establishment mainstay Trump bashed on the campaign trail.  Moreover, Gillespie has largely kept his distance from Trump, rarely mentioning him by name and notably not asking for Trump’s help in a tight race. But Gillespie still needs voters like the Wallers. Trump, who lost Virginia last year by 5 points to Democrat Hillary Clinton, did best in rural areas such as the counties along Virginia’s mountainous spine, less so in urban areas. That tension has Gillespie looking to thread the thinnest of needles, trying to appeal to voters turned off by Trump while retaining enough of Trump’s passionate base to secure victory. Should he win, Gillespie might provide a blueprint for other Republican candidates unsure how to campaign in an era when the president is popular with fewer than 40 percent of Americans.  “If he manages to do this, he’s shown how you engage Trump voters while literally avoiding Donald Trump,” said Quentin Kidd, a political scientist at Christopher Newport University in Newport News, Virginia. The Virginia governor’s race, one of only two in the country this year, is being watched nationally by political observers looking for clues about next year’s midterm elections, in which Democrats are seeking to seize one or both houses of Congress.  Gillespie has been courting Trump voters by focusing on what he says is the threat posed by illegal immigrants, a longtime Trump campaign theme. He has criticized “sanctuary cities” and run ads warning of the street gang MS-13, which is largely composed of members from Central America.  He has also called for preserving Confederate monuments following the clashes between white supremacists and protesters in August in Charlottesville, Virginia.  Once trailing significantly behind Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, Gillespie has risen in the polls since the ads began running regularly. Kidd credits the spots for making the race competitive.  Sanctuary cities, Gillespie told Reuters in an interview, are “not going to make us safer.”  While Virginia has no sanctuary cities, which often do not use municipal funds or resources to enforce federal immigration laws, the issue arose earlier this year when a measure by the state’s legislature to prohibit them was vetoed by Democratic Governor Terry McAuliffe. But some argue Gillespie is being too cautious. Corey Stewart, who ran against Gillespie in the gubernatorial primary and garnered support from Trump’s base, said Gillespie erred in not asking the president to campaign for him and in not doing more to harness the energy Trump has stirred. “He’s put the president at a distance, and he has offended a lot of the president’s supporters,” Stewart said. “And it could cost him the election.” Trump has tweeted his support for Gillespie, but that is as far as it has gone.  Gillespie said he appreciated Trump’s endorsement but declined to say whether he would ask for more, even parroting Trump’s own words in doing so.  “Just like the president doesn’t disclose his military strategy, we don’t disclose our campaign strategy,” he said.  At a recent house party in Fairfax County, Virginia, just outside Washington, Gillespie mixed with a prosperous group of Republicans who snacked on a catered spread and chatted about private schools. He spoke to them about traditional Republican priorities such as economic growth and education reform - and never once mentioned Trump, while referring to other politicians who  support him such as Vice President Mike Pence and George W. Bush. “That’s smart,” said Chris Andreas, a Great Falls, Virginia, resident who attended the event and said he believed Trump had hurt the Republican party. In 2016, Trump fared significantly worse in Fairfax County than Republican nominee Mitt Romney did four years earlier. There are more voters to be gained there than anywhere else in the state.  The strategy’s downside is that while Democrats hold a large advantage in Northern Virginia, they are losing ground in rural areas.  In Warren County, where Front Royal is located, Trump gained 2,000 votes more than Romney largely by attracting wayward Democrats, said Stephen Kurtz, a former chair of the county Republican Party. The pattern, he said, repeated across other counties in rural Virginia.  Kurtz said he had heard grumbling over Gillespie’s Washington background and worries some voters energized by Trump may stay home.  “It is a hard sell, believe me,” Kurtz said.

Asked about Powell’s lack of a PhD, Blankfein said, “I sometimes feel that people with PhDs - and believe me, I am not anti-intellectual, I have a law degree, my kids went to graduate school, I’m not against people who have PhDs — but sometimes I wish people who only have PhDs had a little more life and professional and business experience.” Blankfein also said a good U.S. tax plan will have “stimulative elements” and could get U.S. GDP growth to a higher level than 3 percent. “The free-est kind of stimulus you could provide for the economy is confidence and peeling away redundant or bad regulation, to be frank,” Blankfein said.  Asked about Bitcoin, which soared past $7,000 to a new record high on Thursday, Blankfein said: “I have a level of discomfort with it as I have a level of discomfort with anything that’s new. But I learned over the years that there’s a lot of things that work out pretty well that I don’t love. “Right now, I tell you, I don’t have an investment in it.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein will visit China as part of a business delegation in November at the same time as U.S. President Donald Trump, a Goldman spokesman confirmed. Blankfein will be the only executive of a major financial company traveling as part of the trade mission which is being led by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, according to a preliminary list. Executives from major industrial companies including General Electric Co (GE.N), Honeywell International Inc (HON.N) and Boeing Co (BA.N) are on the list, as well as a large number of leaders from energy and commodities firms.  Blankfein has publicly used Twitter to speak out against Trump. In January, he became the first major Wall Street leader to speak out against Trump’s order to halt arrivals from several Muslim-majority countries.  He also criticized the White House’s decision in September to phase out the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a program that protects young, undocumented immigrants from deportation.  China is an important region for Goldman, which ranked as the top M&A dealmaker in Asia-Pacific excluding Japan in the first nine months of the year, according to Thomson Reuters data. While Wall Street firms like Goldman have to partner with a Chinese joint venture firm to run their investment banking businesses on the mainland, U.S. banks have for years been trying to operate these businesses on their own.  Following a trip to Beijing earlier this year, Blankfein said there was a “a lot of confidence in China” and it was “almost an island of stability.”  ",Goldman's Blankfein is only major financial firm CEO to join Trump on China trip
0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump repeatedly says his proposed tax cut would be the biggest in U.S. history, but it will not even come close to the record. Trump would be on target if he were talking only about corporate taxes, but he has included other taxes in his boast. The president and his fellow Republicans in Congress propose cutting the top corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent. If they succeed, it would be the largest American corporate tax cut since the modern corporate tax began more than a century ago. As proposed by the Republicans, the corporate rate would fall 43 percent, compared with the second-largest such cut of 26 percent under Republican President Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.  But on individual taxes, Trump's claim does not hold up, according to data on top personal income tax rates collected by the Tax Foundation, a Washington think tank. (For a graphic tracking U.S. tax rates, see: tmsnrt.rs/2z5Cv20) Some Republicans in Congress are backing away from cutting the top individual tax rate, now 39.6 percent. But even if they did cut it as low as Trump wants, to 35 percent, the president would not even come close to winning bragging rights.    The Reagan cuts lowered the top rate to 28 percent from 70 percent. That was an impressive 60 percent drop. But the huge tax cuts of President Warren Harding and President Calvin Coolidge, both Republicans, take the prize. In 1922, the top tax rate was 73 percent. By 1925, it was only 25 percent, almost a 66 percent decline. Coolidge alone was responsible for a 57 percent cut in taxes. Under President John Kennedy and President Lyndon Johnson, both Democrats, the tax cuts of 1964 and 1965 cut the top rate to 70 percent from 91 percent, a decline of 23 percent. Still, there are other ways to measure the size of a tax cut besides the rates themselves. One approach would measure how much tax revenue the federal government does not get and  taxpayers get to keep. That is the “cost” of a tax cut. But that number is disputed between those who favor tax cuts and those who do not. The Trump administration argues its tax cuts will ignite the economy and tax revenue will increase, not decrease. That way, the cuts “pay for themselves,” they say.  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan Washington think tank, estimated the Trump tax cut could be the fourth-largest as a percentage of gross domestic product, or GDP, a measure of national economic output. The think tank favors that measure because it eliminates the effects of inflation, economic growth and the size of total federal revenue. By that measure, it agreed with a number of economists who said the Reagan cuts were the largest in history, even larger than Coolidge’s.   As for bragging rights to the all-time biggest tax hike, the winner is Democratic President Woodrow Wilson. During World War One, he increased the top individual rate to 77 percent from 7 percent and the corporate rate to 12 percent from 1 percent. ",Trump's tax cut won't be the biggest in U.S. history

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group in the U.S. House of Representatives has called on the Environmental Protection Agency to recognize “the significant pitfalls and costs” of renewable fuel standards in its future rulemaking and enact “well-rounded” biofuel policies. “We look forward to working with you to put forth well-rounded biofuels policies that reflect market realities and benefit American families and businesses,” the 64 lawmakers wrote to EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt on Wednesday in a letter Reuters reviewed on Thursday. An EPA spokesman said in an email that the agency would respond to the group “through the proper channels.” Wednesday’s letter, whose list of signatories was led by Virginia Republican Bob Goodlatte and Vermont Democrat Peter Welch, said the standard had not accomplished any goals it was purportedly designed to meet, like protecting the environment and revitalizing rural America. “By diverting more than 35 percent of the annual corn harvest to fuel additive, the RFS has raised the cost of livestock production, increased food price volatility and insecurity, decreased fuel efficiency, damaged small-engine equipment, hurt the environment and chipped away at household budgets,” the letter said.  Earlier this year, the EPA proposed reexamining several aspects of the standard for renewable fuels, including whether refiners should be responsible for blending them and whether ethanol exports could be included in a marketplace for renewable fuel credits.  But the agency announced on Oct. 19 that it would abandon those efforts after protests from Midwestern lawmakers. “President Trump pledged to support biofuels during his campaign,” said Republican U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa in a statement emailed to Reuters on Thursday. “A strong RFS is consistent with that pledge, and President Trump should be applauded for keeping his word to the country.”  Renewable Fuels Association spokeswoman Rachel Gantz said Goodlatte was “spreading the same lies” about the standard. “The RFS is helping bring about consumer choice by breaking Big Oil’s monopoly at the pump,” she said.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Republicans unveiled long-delayed legislation on Thursday to deliver deep tax cuts that President Donald Trump has promised, setting off a frantic race in Congress to give him his first major legislative victory. The 429-page bill, representing what would be the largest overhaul of the U.S. tax system since the 1980s, called for slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, cutting tax rates on individuals and families and ending certain tax breaks for companies and individuals. Congressional passage of this legislation that would affect nearly every U.S. company and family was far from certain, and some business groups quickly came out against it. Contentious provisions will test Republicans, who control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to deliver any major legislative achievements for Trump since the businessman-turned-politician became president in January. A number of provisions would hit taxpayers in Democratic-leaning states hardest, like rolling back deductions for state and local taxes and cutting in half the popular mortgage interest deduction.  The legislation, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, produces new advantages for rich Americans through lowered corporate taxes, phasing out the estate tax and dumping the alternative minimum tax.  “This is a very important and special moment for our country, for all Americans. Are we going to let the defenders of the status quo win and see our country continue down this downward spiral?” Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan asked, despite data showing about eight straight years of economic growth. Meeting with Ryan and other key House Republicans, Trump told the lawmakers he was counting on them to maintain the momentum for tax cuts, and repeated his request that Congress send him the legislation to sign into law by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. That is an ambitious timetable for such a long, multi-faceted piece of legislation that will face a ferocious lobbying battle among business sectors affected by the bill and fierce opposition from many Democrats. Trump called the bill an “important step” toward tax relief for Americans, adding in a statement, “We are just getting started, and there is much work left to do.” The bill presented by the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee would consolidate the current number of tax brackets to four from seven: 12 percent, 25 percent, 35 percent and 39.6 percent. An earlier Republican tax outline had called for cutting the top rate for the highest earners to 35 percent. The National Association of Home Builders blasted the legislation, saying it would damage home prices and punish homeowners in urban areas.  “We’re concerned if enacted, this bill will throw us back into another housing recession,” Jerry Howard, the group’s president, said in an interview. The group said the provision in the bill capping the interest deduction for future home purchases at $500,000 - half the current amount - was unacceptable. Howard said 7 million homes are currently above $500,000 and in high-cost regions like Washington, D.C., New York City, California and Hawaii, the impact would be felt the most.  The bill would repeal the existing deduction for state and local income and sales taxes, and would cap the deduction for state and local property taxes at $10,000. Those provisions would most affect Americans in higher-tax states such as California, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois. The National Federation of Independent Business, the influential small business lobby, also came out against the bill, while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce business lobby backed it. Ryan said the typical family of four would save $1,182 annually on taxes under the bill.  With Democrats solidly opposed to legislation they see as a giveaway to corporations and the rich that would expand the federal deficit, Republicans can ill afford to lose many in their own ranks as they aim to pass the bill in the coming weeks. “Ultimately, what the American people really get from this tax plan is a huge bill for the debt incurred to pay for tax breaks that line the pockets of Donald Trump personally along with his billionaire buddies. Like a Trump University degree, it is phony,” said Democratic congressman Lloyd Doggett. The bill’s architects avoided one showdown by deciding not to make changes to the popular tax-deferred 401(k) retirement savings program. The bill would roughly double the standard deduction for individuals and families. But it would repeal a personal exemption of $4,050 that taxpayers can currently claim for themselves, their spouse and any dependents. The legislation would also phase out tax-exempt financing for sports stadiums and subject large private universities to 1.4-percent excise tax on investment income. It would also repeal a long standing prohibition on religious institutions being involved in political activities. The bill would create a new family tax credit and double exemptions for estate taxes on inherited assets, while also allowing small businesses to write off loan interest. The bill would cap the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises at 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on “pass-through” income of 39.6 percent. It would set standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new, lower tax level. It would create a new 10-percent tax on U.S. companies’ high-profit foreign subsidiaries, calculated on a global basis, in a move to prevent companies from moving profits overseas. Foreign businesses operating in the United States would face a tax of up to 20 percent on payments they make overseas from their American operations. U.S. equities have rallied in 2017 to a series of record highs, partly on expectations of deep corporate tax cuts. Shares of U.S. homebuilders fell after the bill was released, with luxury homebuilders including Toll Brothers taking the biggest hit. As investors parsed its provisions, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up modestly and the S&P 500 was down slightly. Investors cautioned the tax plan was preliminary and it was too soon to gauge the effect on specific industries. [nL2N1N81IG] The Ways and Means Committee will begin formal consideration of the bill next week before the full House can vote on it. It also must pass the Senate, where Republicans hold a slimmer 52-48 majority and earlier this year failed to garner enough votes to approve a major healthcare overhaul sought by Trump.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"PATERSON, N.J. (Reuters) - With its enormous Muslim population and reputation as a welcoming home for immigrants of some 50 nationalities, the New Jersey city of Paterson was the perfect place for the suspect in the New York City truck attack to go largely unnoticed. Sayfullo Saipov, 29, lived there with his wife and three young children for more than a year before authorities say he drove a rented truck through throngs of people on a lower Manhattan bike path on Tuesday, killing eight people in what officials called an act of terrorism. With one of the largest Muslim populations in the United States, estimated by community leaders at between 25,000 and 30,000 people, the city of nearly 150,000 boasts more than a half dozen mosques and many Middle Eastern and other ethnic restaurants.  Within blocks of Saipov’s apartment, Lebanese, Turkish and Mediterranean restaurants line the streets with signs in Arabic and English, serving immigrants from numerous European, African and Asian countries as well as a sizeable Hispanic population. The city’s Muslim stores attract visitors from Philadelphia to Connecticut, said Ken Abuassab, director of the Paterson-based American Arab Civil Organization. Saipov’s apartment complex abuts the Omar Mosque, though several members said in the interviews they had never seen him there. Ramy Elhelw, 30, a lifelong member of the mosque, said the city serves as a kind of central hub for Muslims across the state.  “No matter where you are in New Jersey, you come to Paterson for your halal breads, restaurants, weddings, funerals,” he said. “Halal” refers to food or drink allowed under Islamic dietary laws. Paterson, nearly 20 miles (32 km) west of northern Manhattan, is a natural landing spot for immigrants seeking a new job or a new life, given the communal infrastructure already in place for Muslims from any number of countries, he added. “Paterson is a melting pot of multiple nationalities,” Elhelw said. “We don’t have red lines.”  Like many former New Jersey industrial centers, Paterson has struggled in recent decades, plagued by a stagnant economy and high violent crime rates. Paterson native Maria Mazziotti Gillan, 77, acknowledged the city has had its share of problems but said immigrants are crucial to its chances of revival. “With these new immigrants coming in and starting new restaurants in South Paterson – a lot of Arab restaurants, a lot of grocery stores that are catered toward Turkish people or people from Syria or Palestine – I’m seeing a kind of resurgence,” she said. Neighbors near Saipov’s two-bedroom rental apartment in a 10-unit, two-story brick complex said he was a quiet man who took his young daughters to school in the mornings and spent his evenings with a small circle of friends. Saipov moved to the United States from his Central Asian homeland on a so-called diversity visa in 2010. Three years later, according to CNN, he married a 19-year-old Uzbek, Nozima Odilova, in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. A neighbor in Paterson, Altana Dimitrovska, told Reuters the couple’s two daughters looked to be age 4 and 6, and that the they had an infant son. Odilova typically wore a head covering and a burka, leaving only her eyes exposed, Dimitrovska said. Saipov’s alleged attack is not the first time Paterson has found itself in the headlines following a militant strike. Hours after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks destroyed the World Trade Center in New York, rumors spread that Muslims in Paterson were celebrating, though police who rushed downtown found only people in prayer. The false report lived on as an urban myth. Saipov is also the second New Jersey man accused of a New York attack in the last 13 months. Ahmad Rahimi, who lived in Elizabeth, New Jersey, was convicted this month of setting off bombs in both Manhattan and New Jersey last fall, injuring 30 people.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has gathered enough evidence to charge six members of the Russian government in the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers before the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing people familiar with the investigation. Federal agents and prosecutors in Washington, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Francisco have been cooperating on the DNC investigation and prosecutors could bring the case to court next year, it said. By identifying individual Russian military and intelligence hackers with charges, U.S. authorities could make it difficult for them to travel, but arrests and jailing would be unlikely, according to the Journal report. The hacking investigation, conducted by cybersecurity experts, predates the appointment in May of federal special counsel Robert Mueller to oversee the probe of alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election and possible collusion with President Donald Trump’s campaign. Mueller and the Justice Department agreed to allow the technical cyber investigation to continue under the original team of agents and prosecutors, the Journal said. U.S. intelligence agencies have said Russian intelligence agencies were behind those cyber attacks, which resulted in thousands of emails and other documents being made public by WikiLeaks last year. The intelligence community concluded in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the campaign to sway the election in Trump’s favor. Russia has denied it meddled in the election and Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with the Russian government. If the case is brought by federal prosecutors, it would pinpoint the specific Russian military and intelligence hackers behind the attack on the DNC and the emails of John Podesta, who was campaign chairman for Trump’s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton. It would be the second time the United States charged Russians with cyber crimes. In March, the Justice Department  charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding the 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, breaking with precedent by denying Janet Yellen a second term but signaling a continuation of her cautious monetary policies. Powell, 64, a lawyer and investment banker appointed to the Fed board in 2012 by then-President Barack Obama, emerged as Trump’s choice from a slate of possible nominees that included Yellen and others who may have pursued a sharp policy shift. In an announcement at the White House, Trump described the soft-spoken Powell as a smart and committed leader who would build on Yellen’s achievements in steering the U.S. economy after the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. “If we are to sustain all this progress, our economy requires sound monetary policy and prudent oversight,” Trump said as Powell looked on. “We need strong and steady leadership at the U.S. Federal Reserve ... He will provide exactly that.”   Powell has worked alongside Yellen for the past five years, backing her direction on monetary policy and, in recent years, sharing her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates. Yellen’s four-year term as Fed chief ends in early February 2018. She will be the first U.S. central bank chief not to be renominated to a second term since 1979. Trump on Thursday lauded Yellen’s stewardship but did not say why he decided to pass her over for another term. The Republican president said he was impressed by Powell’s experience in the private-sector and “real-world perspective” to government.  “He understands what it takes for our economy to grow,” Trump said. Powell, who in the last 25 years has done a prototypical Washington circuit of government, private, and think tank jobs, pledged to be attuned to emerging financial risks and the impact the Fed has on average Americans. He will take over an economy that has been expanding for more than eight years and one that boasts an unemployment rate at more than a 16-1/2-year low.  “Monetary policy decisions matter for American families and communities. I strongly share that sense of mission and am committed to making decisions with objectivity and based on the best available evidence,” Powell said in brief remarks after Trump’s announcement. His nomination now goes to the Republican-controlled Senate for confirmation. “I’m encouraged by President Trump’s choice,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said in a statement that pledged “timely” consideration of the nomination. There was little apparent market reaction to Powell’s nomination, which had been expected. Investors were largely focused on the release of details of a Republican plan to broadly change the U.S. tax code. By setting benchmark short-term interest rates, the Fed broadly influences borrowing and lending conditions in the economy. Since the crisis, the central bank has gained more power over the financial sector, while becoming more concerned about issues like income inequality. Yellen, a Fed veteran who has served at all levels of the sprawling central bank system, said in a written statement that she would work with Powell “to ensure a smooth transition.” Trump’s decision, after a broad and very public search, offers what analysts said was a classic compromise, allowing him to select his own Fed chief while getting continuity with the policies of the Yellen-run central bank. “The kernel of what this boiled down to is that in selecting Powell, (Trump) has all but selected Yellen,” said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and author of a recent book on Fed politics. “There is not really much daylight, if any.” In June, Powell laid out both a defense of the Fed’s gradualist path and a critique of those, including some of his competitors for the Fed job, who argued the central bank had increased the risk of high inflation and other problems. Trump on several occasions has said he would prefer rates to stay low, a position apparently at odds with some of those who were on his short list, particularly Stanford University economist John Taylor and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. Top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn also was a contender. Powell has been a reliable supporter of the consensus forged by Yellen on the policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, and likely will be seen as a less risky choice with the economy growing solidly and U.S. stock markets near record highs. The Fed has raised rates twice this year and is widely expected to do so again next month. But Powell has gone further than his colleagues in calling to relax some of the stricter regulations imposed after the crisis, also important to Trump. Powell can now pursue that end along with Trump appointee Randal Quarles, the Fed’s new vice chair for supervision. Though he will be the first Fed chief since the late 1970s  without an advanced degree in economics, Powell brings market insights, Fed board experience and Republican ties that analysts say will likely make for a smooth confirmation and transition. Under President George H.W. Bush, Powell oversaw policy on financial institutions and debt markets as an undersecretary of the Treasury. From 1997 to 2005 he was a partner at the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm, and focused on public debt dynamics while at the Bipartisan Policy Center think tank. Yellen is entitled to remain as a Fed governor until 2024, though previous central bank chiefs have traditionally not stayed once a successor was in place.

0,True,"November 2, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, who served briefly as Donald Trump’s election campaign manager, and business associate Rick Gates are expected to make their first appearances on Thursday before the U.S. judge overseeing a criminal case brought by a special counsel investigating campaign ties to Russia. Manafort, 68, and Gates, 45, who also worked on the Republican’s campaign, pleaded not guilty before a magistrate judge on Monday to a 12-count indictment, ranging from conspiracy to launder money, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. Also on Thursday, former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page is scheduled to testify to the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee behind closed doors about his dealings with Russians. Page has repeatedly denied serving as an intermediary between Trump’s campaign and Russia, which had been under U.S. economic sanctions for several years at the time of last year’s election campaign. Monday’s charges were an opening salvo by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, whose investigators are probing allegations by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia interfered in the election to undermine Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton to help Trump. The inquiry also will determine whether or not there was any coordination between Russians and associates of the Trump campaign. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied meddling and Trump has denied potential collusion between his associates and Russia, calling the investigations a witch hunt. George Papadopoulos, another former member of the Trump campaign’s small foreign policy team, pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and will not face trial. A lawyer for Papadopoulos declined comment. Thursday’s hearing will be the first in the courtroom of U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who was appointed by former president Barack Obama and has handled a series of high-profile cases over the past few years. The 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) hearing is expected to focus on setting bail conditions. Manafort and Gates are under house arrest, released on unsecured bonds of $10 million and $5 million, respectively. Manafort, a longtime lobbyist, political consultant and lawyer, and Gates should be given stiff bail terms because of their “history of deceptive and misleading conduct”, their “significant financial resources” and the “potentially significant sentences” they face, prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A conviction on conspiracy to launder money alone could carry a sentence of up to 20 years in prison.  Prosecutors also said there was a risk of flight. Manafort holds three U.S. passports and frequently travels abroad. Asked about the information in the filing, Manafort spokesman Jason Maloni said on Wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.” Kevin Downing, Manafort’s lawyer, did not respond to a request for comment ahead of the hearing. It is not clear whether Gates, who was represented by a court-appointed lawyer on Monday, has retained counsel. The charges did not state any direct connections to the Trump campaign or allegations of collusion. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign in March 2016. Manafort served as campaign manager from June to August. In Tuesday’s court filing, prosecutors said Manafort and Gates had connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs.  Downing said earlier this week that there was no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government.  ",Two ex-Trump aides head to U.S. court on charges in Russia probe
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers released a batch of Russian-bought Facebook Inc ads on Wednesday that showcased politically charged content allegedly spread on social media by Moscow ahead of the 2016 U.S. election.  Some of the ads criticized candidates, while others sought to organize or promote simultaneous rallies for opposite sides of divisive issues. The sample posted on a House committee website pulled from the roughly 3,000 ads Facebook provided to congressional investigators last month.  Tech companies recently acknowledged that Russia-based content on U.S. politics and social issues like gun rights, immigration, religion and race had spread on their platforms before and after the election. Some of the ads sampled specifically dealt with the U.S. election and were critical of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. One from an account called “Army of Jesus” said Clinton was supported by evil forces. “Hillary is a Satan, and her crimes and lies had proved just how evil she is,” the post read. It added that Republican candidate Donald Trump was “an honest man” who “cares deeply for this country.” Other ads appeared to be aimed at setting up clashes over hot-button issues.  One ad from a group calling itself “Heart of Texas” promoted a rally in Houston on May 21, 2016 to “Stop Islamization” in the U.S. state. Another ad from a separate Facebook page promoted a pro-Islam rally at the same time and venue. The Russian government has denied any attempts to sway the 2016 election, in which U.S. President Donald Trump defeated Clinton. The ads were released at a U.S. House Intelligence Committee hearing, where lawyers from Facebook, Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google testified about Russian influence on their networks.  It was the second straight day the companies attempted to ward off criticism from lawmakers that they were slow to respond to Russian abuse. Facebook, the world’s largest social media network, again came under the most scrutiny from lawmakers, who expressed frustration with the company because of its role in targeted marketing.  Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch told the committee that 16 million Americans may have been exposed to Russian information on Facebook’s picture-sharing service Instagram beginning in October 2016. The election was on Nov. 8. An additional four million may have seen such material on Instagram before October, though that data was less complete, Stretch said. The Instagram figures were in addition to the 126 million Americans who may have seen Russian-backed political content on Facebook over a two-year period, a number the company disclosed earlier this week. The companies’ visit to Washington this week reflected shifting political fortunes for the U.S. tech industry, which after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny is now on the defensive on a range of policy issues. “In the past election, you failed,” said Democratic Senator Ron Wyden, who normally is considered a strong ally of Silicon Valley. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia interfered in the campaign, including through social media, to try to influence the vote in favor of Trump.  A U.S. Justice Department special counsel and several congressional panels are investigating Russian meddling and any potential collusion by Trump’s campaign.  Trump has said there was no collusion with Moscow ahead of the election. Democrats and Republicans both said in Wednesday’s Senate intelligence hearing that the tech companies need to do more to police against foreign government abuse on their platforms. Some Republicans, however, sought to distance that scrutiny from questions about the legitimacy of Trump’s election victory. Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the panel, said it was impossible to measure the impact or know the motivation of the Russian operation to spread political material on social media.  Any conclusions that Trump benefited from Russia, perhaps in a decisive way, to win the White House ignored the complexity of the issue, Burr said. “I’m here to tell you this story does not simplify that easily,” he said. Some Republicans also sought to portray the amount of Russian content as miniscule compared to the total amount of political material online.  The campaigns of Trump and Clinton spent a combined $81 million on Facebook ads, Stretch said, compared to about $46,000 in ad buys from the Internet Research Agency, a suspected Russian troll farm. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the panel, said he was disappointed the companies appeared be confining reviews to information linked to the Internet Research Agency, and suggested there could have been far more undetected Russian content. Some senators criticized the companies for sending lawyers, not chief executives, to testify.  “If we go through this exercise again, we would appreciate seeing the top people who are making the decision,” said Senator Angus King, an independent.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will further pressure Chinese President Xi Jinping in talks next week to take tougher measures against North Korea, as the United States compiles information for possible new sanctions on Chinese banks working with Pyongyang. Senior administration officials say Trump will try to convince Xi when they meet in Beijing to squeeze North Korea with steps such as limits on oil exports, coal imports and financial transactions. It is the latest attempt by Trump to have China, North Korea’s only major ally, rein in Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons ambitions but it is far from clear if Xi, who has just consolidated his power at a Communist Party congress, will agree. China says its leverage over Pyongyang is exaggerated, and points to its support in the U.N. Security Council for recent sanctions on North Korea as evidence that it is trying to curtail the isolated nation’s nuclear and missile tests.     North Korea this year conducted a powerful nuclear test detonation and has test-fired intercontinental ballistic missiles that, if perfected, could reach the U.S. mainland. Trump has vowed to prevent North Korea gaining that capability. Two U.S. officials said the threat of additional U.N. and other economic sanctions on North Korea is another option to solicit greater cooperation from China, by playing on Beijing’s concerns that deeper poverty in North Korea could prompt an exodus of refugees across its border. The officials said the United States and its allies have been collecting detailed information on Chinese bank transactions with North Korea to try to identify institutions with the “most egregious” records of doing business with Pyongyang. The objective, the officials said, is to craft a proposal for escalating sanctions on Chinese financial and other entities that stops short of sanctioning the People’s Bank of China central bank. Washington so far has mostly held off on new sanctions against Chinese banks and companies doing business with North Korea, given fears of retaliation by Beijing and possibly far-reaching effects on the world economy. In a brief statement on Thursday formally announcing the visit from the Chinese end, the country’s foreign ministry said China was ready to work with the United States to achieve “important results” for Trump’s visit. It did not elaborate.   Trump’s stop in Beijing is part of a Nov. 3-14 tour of five Asian nations in which North Korea will be a major focus. The visit includes U.S. allies Japan and South Korea who have watched with increasing worry as the United States and North Korea have exchanged bellicose rhetoric.     To prepare for his trip, Trump met with former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, a key player in President Richard Nixon’s opening to China in 1972.  And over lunch last week at the White House, Trump asked Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong for his opinion about North Korea and its unpredictable leader, a participant said. Lee told him that Kim sees his nuclear weapons program as essential to his survival after the U.S.-led ouster of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddhafi’s downfall. “Lee said it’s probably impossible for Kim to become convinced that the United States doesn’t want to overthrow him,” a participant at the lunch said. “They’re super-paranoid.”                     While part of the U.S. strategy on North Korea is to deprive Kim Jong Un’s government of resources, Trump has left open the threat of military force. U.S. officials, while emphasizing they want a diplomatic solution, have highlighted military preparedness to counter a North Korean threat and there are three U.S. aircraft carrier groups in the region. Trump has threatened to “totally destroy” North Korea and has derided Kim as a “Rocket Man” on a suicide mission, to the dismay of some U.S. military and intelligence officials who fear such rhetoric could backfire.      As well as pressuring China, the United States is quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, using a “New York channel” to get in contact with diplomats at Pyongyang’s United Nations mission.  Analysts in Asia are skeptical Trump’s pressure on China will work. “I don’t think China will seriously change its existing policy on North Korea simply because of more pressure from the United States,” said Zhao Tong, a North Korea expert at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center in Beijing.     China’s ambassador to the United States, Cui Tiankai, told reporters on Monday it will take a broad effort to pressure North Korea and China alone cannot solve the problem. “China has been doing everything we can on the Korean issue,” he said. In Japan, the threat from Pyongyang hit close to home after tests this year in which two ballistic missiles flew over its territory. But there is concern in Tokyo that the Trump administration lacks a clear North Korea strategy. “The biggest worry is that Trump’s grand Asia policy, North Korea policy, is not well defined... but responds to circumstances instead... ,” said Toshihiro Nayakama, a professor at Keio University. “They turn to China to exert pressure but the question is to what extent there is Chinese pressure. I believe this is not yet evaluated by the U.S. administration,” he said. The Trump administration has considered threatening China with trade actions over its resistance to do more on North Korea. While some advisers from outside his administration have  urged Trump to pursue this course, he has been persuaded against it by his own advisers who have warned of a trade war, U.S. officials said.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives were expected on Thursday to release a tax bill offering plenty of flexibility, as they grapple with stubborn internal disagreements on paying for the tax cuts they propose. After an embarrassing one-day postponement of the bill’s unveiling on Wednesday, lawmakers have made plans for a measure that will seek up to $6 trillion in tax cuts over 10 years but likely not spell out completely how to offset them. Asked if the bill would contain a permanent corporate tax rate cut to 20 percent from 35 percent, U.S. House of Representatives tax panel Chairman Kevin Brady told reporters: “That’s our goal and I think it’s going to take several steps ... to achieve that.” Lobbyists said Republicans were having trouble reaching consensus on where to find revenue to pay for tax cuts and would likely have to make the corporate cut temporary as a result.  After a White House meeting with advisers, President Donald Trump told reporters: “Sometime tomorrow, we’ll be announcing massive tax cuts and reform.” House Republican leaders and tax panel members were slated to meet with Trump in the White House on Thursday afternoon. From mortgage interest and 401(k) retirement plans to the federal deficit and state and local taxes, numerous unanswered questions swirled around the tax-cut plan as lawmakers met into the evening on Capitol Hill. Representative Tom MacArthur, asked if fellow Republicans could meet their ambitious deadline of approving a tax bill by the Nov. 23 Thanksgiving holiday, told reporters: “I’ve been called a lot of things but ‘prophet’ is not one of them.” Since taking over Congress and the White House in January, the Republicans and Trump have yet to score a major legislative accomplishment. That will change, they say, when they overhaul the tax code for the first time in 31 years. But they are fast discovering why every attempt to do that has failed since former Republican President Ronald Reagan’s historic tax reform in 1986. Unlike the nearly three-year Reagan effort involving public hearings and bipartisan cooperation, the Trump tax plan was developed in secret over a few months by six senior lawmakers and White House advisers who took little input from rank-and-file Republicans and largely ignored the Democrats. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said in a statement that the “chaotic delay” of the tax bill’s release showed Republicans were “pushing a half-baked tax bill with ruinous consequences for workers and middle-class Americans.” MacArthur said the plan’s biggest challenge was a proposed elimination of a deduction for state and local tax (SALT) payments, which is among several revenue-raising changes meant to offset proposed tax cuts. Other lawmakers and lobbyists cited different concerns with the bill.. Republicans from high-tax states where upper-middle-class voters would be hardest hit by the SALT deduction repeal were unsure if the bill on Thursday would address their concerns. Representative Lee Zeldin from New York said he wanted “major changes” to preserve state and local tax deductibility. “I was encouraged when I heard Chairman Brady refer to the draft that’s about to get released as not being the final text,” said Zeldin. MacArthur, from New Jersey, said a compromise proposal being worked on to maintain and cap the deductibility of property tax payments was a good start but the cap would need to be raised to earn his support. Trump, largely playing cheerleader in the debate, tweeted advice on paying for the cuts. “Wouldn’t it be great to Repeal the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate in ObamaCare and use those savings for further Tax Cuts,” he said in a Twitter post. Afterward, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters that the administration still wanted to repeal and replace Obamacare, but “we still think it’s probably more likely to do something like that in the spring.” An attempt to dismantle former Democratic President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, failed dramatically in the Republican-controlled Senate in July. 401(k) IN PLAY Another contentious revenue-raising proposal in the plan is to limit how much money Americans can put into their 401(k) retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) on a pre-tax basis. There was also a proposal to limit the deductibility of interest payments by businesses. Restrictions are opposed by businesses with little access to equity financing, including farmers, ranchers and small businesses. A rough framework of the tax plan was unveiled in late September, but its basic components were changing. It originally called for reducing the number of tax brackets to three from seven, with the current top tax rate of 39.6 percent reduced to 35 percent, a win for high-income taxpayers. Partly in response to Democrats who dismissed the plan as a giveaway to corporations and the wealthy, lawmakers are expected to restore a fourth 39.6 percent tax bracket but increase the income level where it applies, perhaps to $1 million, more than double the current level. Questions remained about the original framework’s proposal to repeal the estate tax on inheritances, another policy change that would favor wealthy Americans. Discussion was ongoing about possibly phasing it out.    Lawmakers also have not resolved a challenge posed by Trump’s plan to lower the tax rate on pass-through enterprises, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 25 percent from as high as 39.6 percent, they said.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday seized on the deadly New York City truck attack to step up demands for stricter U.S. immigration laws, asking Congress to end a visa program that let the Uzbek suspect into the country and saying he might send him to Guantanamo Bay. In a day of harsh recriminations over Tuesday’s attack that killed eight people in America’s largest city, Trump appeared to assign some blame for an incident that authorities have labeled as terrorism to top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, who accused Trump of politicizing a national tragedy.  Trump said he would consider sending the suspect, identified by authorities as Sayfullo Saipov, to the military prison at the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, which his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama tried but failed to shut. No detainee has been sent to the Guantanamo prison since 2008. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters that Trump considers Saipov an “enemy combatant,” a designation that would curtail his legal rights. Trump called the suspect “this animal” and lambasted the U.S. justice system for terrorism suspects as “a joke” and “a laughingstock.” Since taking office in January, Trump has sought to increase deportations of illegal immigrations and limit legal immigration. The Department of Homeland Security said Saipov entered the United States in 2010 through the so-called diversity visa program, designed to provide a path to U.S. residency for citizens from countries with historically low rates of immigration to the United States. Authorities said Saipov drove a rented truck along a bike path in lower Manhattan, mowing down cyclists and pedestrians. Police shot and wounded Saipov before arresting him. Trump reprised what has been his stance as a White House candidate and as president - that tougher immigration laws should be a first line of defense against such attacks. “I’m going to ask Congress to immediately initiate work to get rid of this program,” Trump told reporters at the White House.  “We have to get much tougher,” he said. “We have to get much smarter. And we have to get much less politically correct. We’re so politically correct that we’re afraid to do anything.” Schumer helped create the diversity visa program in 1990 when he in the House of Representatives, but he was also part of a bipartisan group of lawmakers who crafted an immigration bill in 2013 that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but killed by the Republican-led House. The program, via a lottery, selects up to 50,000 people per year who receive U.S. visas, and eventually permanent residence in the United States. Those selected undergo U.S. security checks before being allowed to immigrate. “The terrorist came into our country through what is called the ‘Diversity Visa Lottery Program,’ a Chuck Schumer beauty. I want merit based,” Trump wrote on Twitter. Sanders said later that Trump does not blame Schumer for the attack and would “love” to work with the senator on tougher immigration laws. Trump on Wednesday also renewed his call for a “merit-based” visa system - which would favor the highly skilled - and for ending “chain migration,” which allows legal immigrants to apply for relatives abroad to come to the United States. Trump said there were “23 people that came in or potentially came in” with Saipov. Asked if legislation to end the visa program would be taken up, No. 2 Senate Republican John Cornyn told reporters that Congress must first pass legislation to protect illegal immigrants brought into the country as children, “and then the next thing we need to do is turn to our legal immigration system and see how we can change it.” Trump accused congressional Democrats of blocking immigration legislation that would make the nation safer. “We have a lot of good bills in there. We’re being stopped by Democrats because they’re obstructionists. And honestly, they don’t want to do what’s right for our country,” Trump said. Both the Senate and the House are controlled by Trump’s fellow Republicans. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham criticized the Trump administration for not declaring Saipov, who remained hospitalized after being shot in the abdomen by a police officer on Tuesday, as an “enemy combatant.” “It’s ridiculous to believe that one day of interviews in a hospital tells us all we need to know about Saipov’s terrorist ties,” Graham said in a statement. The complaint filed against Saipov said he had waived his rights and agreed to speak to investigators without an attorney present. As a presidential candidate, Trump called for a total ban on Muslims entering the country as a counter-terrorism measure. Courts have blocked his latest executive action barring entry into the United States by people from several Muslim-majority countries. Sanders said the White House has not ruled out adding Uzbekistan to the list of countries named in the travel ban. In a speech on the Senate floor, Schumer said that “instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, (Trump) should be bringing us together and focusing on the real solution, anti-terrorism funding, which he proposed to cut in his most recent budget.” ","Trump calls for ending visa program after N.Y. attack, blasts Democrats"
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives’ energy committee on Wednesday said it wants the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to explain how it is overseeing contracts for rebuilding Puerto Rico’s power grid after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria. In a letter to FEMA, the committee raised questions about contracts between Puerto Rico’s Electric Power Authority (PREPA) and two companies: Whitefish Energy Holdings and Cobra Acquisitions LLC, a subsidiary of Mammoth Energy Services Inc. Six weeks after the hurricane swept across the island, two-thirds of its residents are still without electricity. Washington is preparing to spend billions on relief for the territory, home to 3.4 million Americans, with assistance for the grid seen as one of the most expensive and complex pieces of the aid. The House Energy and Commerce committee - one of several panels of lawmakers keeping a close eye on Puerto Rico projects - said in its letter that “federal leadership and strategic coordination” are needed to restore power, and outlined a series of concerns about the role played so far by FEMA. Usually, power utilities seek help from other utility companies to restore power immediately after disasters. But Puerto Rico first turned to contractors, as utilities were leery about getting paid by PREPA, which declared bankruptcy in July. On Sunday, Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello and PREPA said they would cancel a $300 million contract with Whitefish Energy Holdings, after a controversy over the deal’s provisions and the Montana company’s lack of experience with projects of such a large size. The committee said it was concerned about FEMA’s oversight of the Whitefish contract. “We have a contract with PREPA, and how PREPA and FEMA are interacting, that is PREPA’s issue,” a spokesman for Whitefish said in a statement. Lawmakers also questioned provisions in a PREPA contract issued to Cobra Acquisitions, including “language which would appear to have the effect of preventing government oversight of the agreement.” In a statement, Cobra said its managers met with PREPA at its command center and “described the company’s experience, ability to mobilize quickly and its plan to aid in the restoration of power to the island. We also met with representatives of FEMA, the Army Corps of Engineers and other key agencies.” FEMA asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on Sept. 30 to take on an extra role in emergency repairs of the grid because of the scope of the damage. The Army Corps has awarded some of its own contracts and is boosting its presence. The lawmakers asked FEMA to brief its staff by Nov. 15. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. FEMA Administrator Brock Long testified to a Senate committee on Tuesday that the agency was not notified until “several weeks after the fact” that PREPA had contracted with Whitefish, and had not agreed to the contract language. “Not one dollar has gone toward that contract from FEMA,” Long said, telling senators that the agency is making sure PREPA has not asked for reimbursement for the work. Long told senators that FEMA’s coordinator on the island has asked PREPA to “make sure that we are unified with the Army Corps so we’re not working in separate streams, but we’re working together in a consolidated effort.” ",House questions FEMA over Puerto Rico power contracts
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives are due to release tax legislation on Thursday calling for slashing taxes on corporations, repealing some taxes paid primarily by the wealthy and adjusting other taxes on families and individuals.  As questions about the final shape of the bill swirl around Washington, the following is a look at the basic features of the plan released in September, though changes are expected: * Reduce the U.S. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a current statutory 35 percent. * Eliminate the corporate alternative minimum tax. * Move to a territorial tax system that no longer imposes the U.S. corporate tax on foreign profits of U.S. companies. * Require U.S. corporations to return assets held overseas at lowered one-time tax rates. * Establish a minimum global tax aimed at the overseas profits of U.S. corporations to prevent tax base erosion. “PASS-THROUGH” BUSINESSES * Limit the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises to 25 percent, down from the present maximum rate on “pass-through” income of 39.6 percent. * Allow immediate and full expensing of capital investments for at least five years. * Partially limit the business tax deduction for debt interest payments. * Cut the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. * Increase the standard deduction for taxpayers to $12,000 from $6,300 for individuals, and to $24,000 from $12,600 for married couples. * Reduce the current seven individual income tax brackets to three brackets of 12 percent, 25 percent and 35 percent. * Consider a fourth bracket at a rate higher than 35 percent for high-income Americans to prevent shifting the overall tax burden from higher- to lower-income households. * Partially repeal the deduction for state and local tax payments. * Eliminate the $4,050 personal exemption for taxpayers and family members. * Create a “substantial” increase in the child tax credit, now $1,000; raise the income limit to qualify for the credit; and eliminate the higher qualifying income rate for married couples. * Create a $500 tax credit for taxpayers with non-child dependents. * Repeal the individual alternative minimum tax on high-income taxpayers. * Repeal the estate tax paid chiefly by the richest Americans.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - The rollout of a tax-cut plan being promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump and senior congressional Republicans was delayed on Wednesday as groups of lawmakers and special interests dug in on key provisions, insisting on changes. Here are some of the most contentious issues in the tax debate, which likely will play out over the coming weeks and months before it can garner enough support to pass Congress and be sent to Trump to sign into law. 401(k). Republicans are eyeing new limits on how much money Americans can pump each year into their 401(k) retirement accounts on a pre-tax basis. Lower limits for tax-free contributions would produce new revenue to help Republicans pay for tax cuts they have proposed for high-income earners, corporations and wealthy families’ inheritances. Taxpayers now can channel $18,000 of income tax-free into 401(k)s. Republican tax writers initially proposed lowering that cap to $2,400 and, after pushback, that number has been in flux. Firms that manage 401(k) plans, Wall Street firms that execute trades for them and the 54 million Americans who have 401(k) accounts could be hurt by such a change. Mortgages. Americans can now deduct mortgage interest from their incomes if they itemize deductions. The plan does not call for changing that directly but it does call for doubling the standard deduction, a separate tax return line that determines eligibility for itemizing. Doubling that would mean fewer Americans itemizing - and fewer deducting mortgage interest. Critics say doubling the standard deduction would make the mortgage-interest deduction a benefit for only higher-income taxpayers. The National Association of Home Builders has declared opposition to the Republican plan and proposed creating a new, non-itemized tax credit for mortgage interest. SALT. A proposal to eliminate a popular tax deduction for state and local tax (SALT) payments has threatened to derail the Republican plan. Democratic and Republican lawmakers from high-tax states, such as New York, California and New Jersey, oppose this change because it would hit their constituents hardest. Real estate interests have fought for an exemption of state and local property taxes, which is expected to make it into the bill, with a cap. Some SALT-state Republicans say they would be satisfied with an adequate property-tax deduction; others have said they will push to preserve income-tax deductibility. Pass-throughs. Republicans want to cut the tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, such as partnerships and sole proprietorships, to 25 percent from as high as 39.6 percent. Winners from this would include many pass-throughs that are small mom-and-pop businesses but it would also benefit big enterprises, such as hedge funds and real estate partnerships. Losers would be upper middle-class wage-earners unable to channel their incomes through pass-through structures. Some tax experts warn slashing the pass-through rate could unleash new tax-dodging schemes to enable Americans to do just that: run their personal incomes through pass-through structures such as partnerships, corporations and sole proprietorships. Tax negotiators are examining ways to limit what types of professional partnerships would qualify for a new pass-through rate. They also are weighing a proposal to limit the new rate to only 30 percent of business income. Business interest. Another change being evaluated by Republicans is ending or further restricting tax deductibility of business interest. This would mean business borrowers could no longer write off the interest they pay on debts. Businesses have formed a group, called the BUILD Coalition, to oppose the provision. Members include Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), Owens-Illinois (OI.N), S&P Global (SPGI.N) and lobbying groups for private equity firms, farmers, mortgage bankers, real estate investment trusts, casinos and equipment leasing groups. Tax writers are looking at ways to exempt small businesses and allow them to continue to deduct business interest on debts. Deficit. Not long ago, most Republicans stood firmly against increasing the federal budget deficit and the national debt but analysts say their tax plan would hugely expand both. Washington was expected to collect $3.3 trillion in taxes in 2017 but spend $4 trillion, leaving a deficit of $700 billion. Previous deficits have piled up a national debt of $20 trillion. The Trump tax-cut plan would reduce federal tax revenues by $2.4 trillion in the first 10 years and by $3.4 trillion in the 10 years after that, adding greatly to the deficit and the debt, according to the Tax Policy Center, a non-partisan think tank. The plan would give a small economic boost but soon be overwhelmed by the rising federal debt burden, the center said. Helping the rich. The tax plan has struggled since it was unveiled as a rough framework in September with criticism from Democrats and social activists, who say it is a giveaway to the wealthy and corporations that hurts or neglects others. On that issue, the Tax Policy Center study said, “In 2018, all income groups would see their average taxes fall, but some taxpayers in each group would face tax increases. Those with the very highest incomes would receive the biggest tax cuts.” ","Factbox: Trump tax plan stumbles on local tax deduction, 401(k)"
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc on Wednesday joined a legal challenge by more than 100 tech companies against a decision to end protection for so-called ‘Dreamer’ immigrants, the companies told Reuters. A legal briefing was filed Wednesday afternoon on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which protects immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children from deportation and which the Trump administration has decided to scrap. Tech firms argue that such immigrants are vital to the U.S. economy and that ending the program will hit growth. The filing is in support of a lawsuit filed by California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in the Northern District of California, according to the filing. Tech companies signed on to the amicus brief - a supporting document in a case, submitted by interested parties - also included Airbnb, Microsoft Corp, Salesforce.com Inc, Lyft, Uber [UBER.UL] and Twitter Inc. Becerra filed an additional motion on Wednesday that seeks to put a block on the withdrawal of DACA. That was supported by iPhone maker Apple Inc. “Apple will be harmed significantly if it can no longer benefit from the hard work, creativity, and intelligence of its employees with DACA status,” said Deirdre O’Brien, Apple’s vice president of people, in a filing supporting the motion. Apple employs more than 250 DACA recipients, the filing said.  The lawsuit challenges Trump’s September decision to rescind DACA, which was established by former President Barack Obama in 2012. It is set to expire in March. “DACA’s rescission will inflict serious harm on U.S. companies, all workers, and the American economy as a whole,” the filing reads, according to a draft of the amicus brief provided by one of the companies.  A week ago, dozens of tech companies, including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc and others, formed The Coalition for the American Dream, a group calling for bipartisan legislation this year that would give illegal immigrants a path to permanent residency. Reuters was first to report that the coalition was being formed. About 900,000 immigrants have been shielded from deportation since the DACA program began.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A visa program aimed at diversifying the U.S. immigrant population came under attack from President Donald Trump on Wednesday after he learned that the man accused of killing eight people in New York City on Tuesday used it to enter the country.        Sayfullo Saipov, who was charged in Tuesday’s truck attack, immigrated to the United States from Uzbekistan in 2010 after winning a lottery enabling him to obtain a so-called “diversity visa,” two government officials confirmed to Reuters.  The program, established by Congress and coordinated by the State Department, has its roots in efforts to bring more Irish and Italian immigrants into the United States. Citizens of countries that send relatively few immigrants to the United States can enter a lottery that grants winners permanent U.S. residency. Applicants must have at least a high school education or its equivalent, or relevant work experience. Just under 11.4 million applicants entered the 2016 lottery for 50,000 slots available to winners and their close family members, according to State Department figures. The visa program has succeeded in diversifying the mix of immigrants that come into the United States each year, but has also drawn criticism for being vulnerable to fraud and for posing national security risks. Trump said on Wednesday he would ask Congress to “immediately” initiate efforts to kill the program, and Republican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, who has long called for an end to diversity visas, said in a statement that they pose “a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer helped create the program in 1990 when he was a member of the House of Representatives. But he was also part of a group of lawmakers in 2013 who crafted a bipartisan immigration bill that would have done away with the program. That bill was passed by the Senate but was killed by the Republican-led House. Top congressional Democrats on Wednesday defended the program, saying it subjects all visa recipients “to the same stringent vetting as all other immigrant visa programs.” The only other known instance of a diversity visa beneficiary carrying out a deadly terrorist attack in the United States occurred in 2002. That year, an Egyptian man who had received a diversity visa through his wife years earlier shot and killed two people in a Los Angeles airport. The man had earlier sought asylum in the United States but was rejected. Ultimately, he was allowed to stay in the country after his wife won the lottery. As early as 2004, the State Department’s then-deputy inspector general, Anne Patterson, told Congress her office believed the diversity program “contains significant vulnerabilities to national security” and that terrorists could “attempt to use it to enter the United States as permanent residents.” The agency watchdog recommended barring citizens of countries that sponsor terrorism from the program. Over the years, government audits have exposed sophisticated fraud schemes targeting the program, including extortion rackets, sham marriages and the use of fake identification documents.  In 2007, Congress’s Government Accountability Office issued a report noting that federal law enforcers “believe that some individuals, including terrorists and criminals, could use fraudulent means to enter or remain in the United States.”  The report found, however, “no documented evidence” that diversity visa immigrants “posed a terrorist or other threat.”  A September 2013 State Department inspector general report found that “organized fraud rings masquerading as travel agencies” had hijacked the diversity visa program in Ukraine. Under the scheme, Ukrainians were entered in the lottery without their consent, and then held up for money in exchange for the chance to claim a visa or encouraged to enter into sham marriages if they won.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators on Wednesday said they agreed on a new package of sanctions on North Korea, and that the Senate Banking Committee would act on the legislation next week, while President Donald Trump is on his first trip to Asia since taking office. Among other measures, the “Otto Warmbier Banking Restrictions Involving North Korea Act of 2017,” named after a U.S. student who died after he was imprisoned in North Korea, would strengthen and expand existing sanctions and strengthen Congress’ oversight of North Korea sanctions. It would also impose sanctions on foreign financial institutions, such as Chinese banks found to provide services to any individual targeted for North Korea-related sanctions by the U.S. Congress, a presidential executive order or U.N. Security Council resolution. The new sanctions bill would require Trump, or any other U.S. president, to notify congressional committees of any intention to terminate or suspend the sanctions. It would also require the president to submit regular reports on the system for licensing transactions and regular briefings for Congress by the administration. The international community has been working to come up with a response to North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missiles programs that does not involve potentially catastrophic military action. Members of the U.S. Congress in particular have called for China, and Chinese banks, to do more to clamp down on Pyongyang. North Korea this year conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear detonation and has test-fired a volley of missiles, including intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that, if perfected, could potentially reach the U.S. mainland.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump does not recall a meeting with his foreign policy advisers in March 2016 in which one of them suggested he could arrange a meeting between candidate Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the White House said on Wednesday. George Papadopoulos, an obscure Trump campaign adviser, pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the campaign and Moscow, according to court documents released on Monday. According to the court documents, Papadopoulos, a Chicago-based international energy lawyer, told the March 31, 2016, meeting that he had connections that could help arrange a Trump-Putin meeting. Asked at a news briefing if the Republican president recalled the suggestion by Papadopoulos, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “No I don’t believe he does.” The charges against Papadopoulos were made public just after indictments charging Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide with multiple offenses, including money laundering, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents. The New York Times said Trump, in a telephone conversation with the newspaper on Wednesday, said investigations into possible collusion between his campaign and Russia had not come anywhere near him personally. “I’m not under investigation, as you know,” the Times quoted Trump as saying. Pointing to Manafort’s indictment, the president said:  “There’s not even a mention of Trump in there,” according to the Times. “It has nothing to do with us.” U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russia had meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to discredit Trump’s Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. Trump has denounced the investigations as a witch hunt. Russia denies meddling in the U.S. election. Manafort and Rick Gates on Monday pleaded not guilty to the charges, some of which go back more than a decade and center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates.  ",Trump does not recall suggestion of Putin meeting: White House
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Washington research firm paid a former British spy’s company $168,000 for work on a dossier outlining Russian financial and personal links to Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign, the U.S. firm said in a statement on Wednesday. Although it was public knowledge that Fusion GPS paid for the work, the amount had not been disclosed. Fusion GPS hired former MI6 officer Christopher Steele to collect information about Trump and his advisers. Fusion GPS’ statement said it had told Congress about how  $168,000 was paid last year to Orbis Business Intelligence, Steele’s company. The money paid to Orbis was taken from $1.02 million it received in fees and expenses from the Perkins Coie law firm, the statement said. The law firm represented the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign, although initial research by Fusion into Trump and other Republican primary candidates was commissioned by a conservative website. Steele’s reports are central to investigations by a special counsel and congressional committees into U.S. intelligence agency allegations that Russia tried to help Trump’s campaign. Russia had repeatedly denied the allegations. Trump denies any collusion with Moscow officials, calling the probes a witch hunt. In an Oct. 29 message posted on Twitter, President Trump said the dossier had cost as much as $12 million, without providing evidence. “Never seen such Republican ANGER & UNITY as I have concerning the lack of investigation on Clinton made Fake Dossier (now $12,000,000?),....” Trump tweeted.     Sources familiar with Steele’s work said he began working for Fusion GPS in May 2016 and stopped with the election. Earlier, a Washington-based conservative website backed by a wealthy Republican donor, the Washington Free Beacon, hired Fusion to conduct research on Trump and other Republican candidates.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Commerce Committee will vote next week on a bipartisan proposal that would make it easier to penalize operators of websites that facilitate online sex trafficking, the panel said in a statement on Wednesday. U.S. technology companies including Alphabet’s Google and Facebook have long opposed legislation that would amend what is known as Section 230 of the decades-old Communications Decency Act, arguing it could thwart digital innovation and prompt endless litigation. The vote is a setback for the internet industry, which is witnessing shifting political fortunes in Washington on a range of policy issues after decades of relatively little regulatory scrutiny. Silicon Valley companies generally consider Section 230 a bedrock legal protection because it helps shield companies from liability for the activities of their users. The legislation from Republican Senator Rob Portman and Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal in August came after years of law-enforcement lobbying for a crackdown on the online classified site backpage.com, which is used for sex advertising. The measure would make it easier for states and sex-trafficking victims to sue social media networks, advertisers and others that fail to keep exploitative material off their platforms. In a statement, Portman said the lawmakers should “act with urgency to hold online sex traffickers accountable and give survivors the justice they deserve.” The bill has attracted bipartisan support from about a third of the Senate. A companion measure has similar backing in the House of Representatives. Republicans control both chambers.  Technology lobbyists in recent weeks have engaged in negotiations with lawmakers supportive of the bill in an attempt to narrow its impact.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Virginia Democrat Danica Roem has been called a man by conservative opponents attacking her views on LGBT rights as she campaigns to become the United States’ only transgender state legislator.  Roem does not shy away from her gender identity. In one campaign ad, she applies makeup at a bathroom mirror and takes hormone pills. But rather than focus on the politics of running as a transgender woman, she prefers to discuss traffic gridlock and other issues in the Nov. 7 election for the Virginia House of Delegates. “Transgender people are just as qualified to say, ‘Hey, I can’t stand being stuck in traffic right now. I have some ideas to fix this,’” said Roem, a 33-year-old journalist. “We can be leaders on transportation. We can be leaders on economic development, and yeah, we can be leaders on civil rights too.” Her candidacy comes as more transgender men and women are vying for voices in the political arena where they have been targeted by conservative lawmakers seeking to limit their rights, most notably by restricting bathroom access.      U.S. elections this year could double the country’s number of transgender officeholders, currently at six, according to the Victory Fund, which works to elect lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender candidates. The group has endorsed eight transgender candidates up for election this fall. A transgender man and woman are running for city council in Minneapolis. A mayoral race in Midvale, Utah, and school board contest in Erie, Pennsylvania, are among the other contests with transgender candidates. Nearly 30 races in the 2017-18 election cycle already have a transgender candidate, up from 13 in 2015-16, according to Logan Casey, a research associate at Harvard University tracking them. The community’s electoral push comes as Republican President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed guidance to public schools on allowing transgender students’ bathroom choice and wants to ban transgender people from military service. Other minority groups also have battled discrimination through gains at the polls. But transgender candidates face unique challenges in making their case to voters who often have never met another transgender person, at least not knowingly.     “It’s sort of a double-pronged task that a lot of these candidates have,” Casey said. “They have to run for office and persuade people to vote for them and also educate them about what it means to be a transgender person.” Phillipe Cunningham, a 30-year-old black transgender man running for city council in Minneapolis, once thought he would have no chance at professional success because people would be put off by his gender identity. Now he marvels at the support he is receiving on the campaign trail.  “People see me and they are like, ‘You’re cool and you know what you are talking about, and you really love this community,’” he said. In Galesburg, Illinois, a city of 30,000, 23-year-old Chris King lost an alderman’s race earlier this year in which she emphasized business development. The card she handed to voters also highlighted the diversity she would bring as a transgender woman of color. She braced for the topic to become an issue at public forums, but it never came up.  “I am not 100 percent sure if that is good or bad,” said King, a part-time student and pet stylist, who knows it was discussed privately. “It would open the door for some conversations to happen that need to happen to educate people.” In Virginia, Roem seeks to unseat a 25-year Republican incumbent of the House of Delegates who filed a bill to limit bathroom access for transgender people on the same day Roem launched her candidacy. Delegate Bob Marshall and the state Republican Party use male pronouns to refer to Roem. The party recently sent mailers to voters in her district that took issue with her support for school policies supporting transgender youth, suggesting she wanted to push an agenda on students as young as kindergarten. “The mailers absolutely do not attack Danica’s gender identity,” John Findlay, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, said in a statement.  Marshall did not reply to requests for comment. Roem said Republicans are resorting to bullying after years of failing to address voters’ quality-of-life concerns.  “This is all they have left: transphobic B.S.,” she said in an email on Monday. Roem dreams of the milestone moment that would follow an historic win with her introduction in the legislature as “the gentlewoman from Manassas.” She would smile at two transgender youth she imagines would be watching from the chamber gallery. “That fundamentally changes the conversation,” she said. “And then, let’s get onto business. Then I pursue governing.” ",Out for votes: Battle over rights inspires more U.S. transgender candidates

John Cornyn said a crush of other matters would take up time, so “we probably won’t get to that” (disaster aid) until consideration of a massive bill to fund federal agencies through next Sept. 30. The Trump administration has said it will submit to Congress a third round of disaster aid in mid-November that could total tens of billions of dollars. Congress already has provided over $51 billion Currently, the Republican-controlled Congress is mainly focused on passing a major tax reform bill by year’s end. The disaster aid would help recovery efforts in Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands following Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in August and September. Six weeks after Maria tore through Puerto Rico, the island is struggling to pick up the pieces, and about two-thirds of its residents remain without power. The U.S. territory declared bankruptcy earlier this year and the storm has plunged its economy into deeper uncertainty. The government-wide spending bill could also become a magnet for measures that Democrats, who are in the minority in Congress, want to attach. Those could include a bipartisan plan to temporarily bolster the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as “Obamacare.” Democrats also are hinting that the end-of-year measure could be an opportunity to force passage of legislation protecting from deportation young “Dreamers,” people brought illegally to the United States as children.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senior U.S. Republican and Democratic Senators said on Wednesday they would push ahead with efforts to reach a bi-partisan deal on rolling-back some financial rules introduced the 2008 financial crisis, even after a leading Democratic lawmaker walked away from talks. Their comments bolstered hopes among banking lobbyists that Congress may yet agree legislation to roll-back some aspects of the 2010 Dodd Frank law, potentially cutting billions in costs for banks, after bi-partisan discussions appeared to falter. Senator Sherrod Brown, the leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was stepping away from months-long private negotiations with the Committee’s Republican chair Senator Mike Crapo over rolling-back elements of the 2010 Dodd Frank law, saying they had reached an impasse. On Wednesday, however, Crapo told reporters he was still working towards a regulatory reform bill and would renew efforts to reach a bipartisan compromise.  “I intend to move forward to build a bipartisan solution, and I hope to be able to do so soon,” Crapo told reporters. Bank lobbyists told Reuters they remained optimistic a bill still could be passed, saying Brown’s exit had cleared the path for several Democrats more sympathetic to Crapo’s position to take over the negotiations. Spokespeople for Senators Heidi Heitkamp and Joe Donnelly, two of the banking panel’s moderate Democratic members, told Reuters on Wednesday they were open to rekindling the talks. “Congress needs to make the financial regulatory system work better for everyone, and I’m willing to work with anyone on a deal that would accomplish that goal,” Heitkamp said in a statement. Donnelly said in a statement he believed there was still an opportunity to negotiate a relief package for community financial institutions “while protecting consumers and ensuring the safety of our financial system.” The House of Representatives has already passed a broad rewrite of Dodd-Frank legislation, but the Senate will ultimately determine what, if any, relief the Republican-led Congress hands to banks. Industry expectations on a final deal had been modest because Senate Republicans need eight Democrats to support their efforts in order to pass changes to Dodd Frank.  The exact shape of a regulatory reform bill is not public. There is bipartisan support for easing requirements on smaller banks and credit unions, but reducing the number of banks that face stricter oversight because they are considered critical to the financial system has proved a point of contention. Currently, banks with over $50 billion in assets are considered “systemically important “ and must comply with stricter rules. Republican lawmakers are considering raising that threshold, but this is opposed by some powerful Democrats including Senator Elizabeth Warren. “After working in good faith, it’s clear we will not be able to reach a compromise that protects consumers while supporting small banks and credit unions,” said Brown in a statement. “I continue to support small banks and credit unions, but I cannot agree to gutting protections for working people and taxpayers.” (This version of the story was refiled to add missing word “following” in the lead paragraph) ","Senate Banking chair, Democrats say still hopeful for deal on Dodd-Frank bank rules rewrite"
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - A panel convened by U.S. President Donald Trump to tackle the opioid crisis called on Wednesday for more treatment programs, tighter prescribing guidelines and additional drug courts to help reduce overdose deaths. The commission, led by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, said the recommendations would require funding by Congress but did not recommend an amount. Trump last week declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency. Public health experts broadly welcomed the proposed measures. “This sounds to me like a very progressive and very needed move,” said Professor Kosali Simon, a health economist at Indiana University, of the recommendations.     But Paul Hanly, a New York lawyer representing local governments in a legal battle against opioid makers, said recommendations, while laudable, would be “toothless” without substantial funding. Opioids include prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl. More than 100 Americans die daily from overdoses, according to federal data. The commission recommended a national media campaign to encourage opioid addicts to seek help. Only 10.6 percent of people who need treatment get it, the report noted. The media campaign would encourage addicts to “stop being afraid or ashamed of seeking help when facing their addiction.” It urged expansion of drug courts, in which addicts convicted of non-violent offenses are diverted into programs that combine treatment with mandatory drug testing and court appearances. The commission said drug courts, which are currently offered in just 44 percent of U.S. counties, should embrace medication-assisted treatment to improve outcomes. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week announced plans to encourage wider use of substitute opioids such as methadone and buprenorphine, which do not induce a high and are used to help people through drug addiction recovery. Still, Dr. Stefan Kertesz of the University of Alabama at Birmingham said communities often lack treatment facilities where drug courts can send addicts. And many drug courts charge fees that make them unaffordable for many. “Drug courts often function as pay to play,” Kertesz said. “Only people who can come up with money can escape a prison sentence.” The report recommended expanding the ranks of emergency responders allowed to administer naloxone to treat overdoses. It also encouraged stricter prescribing guidelines for physicians. ",Trump panel urges more treatment options to fight opioid crisis
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Senate Republicans mounted a concerted defense of one of President Donald Trump’s nominees to a federal appeals court on Wednesday, suggesting a nonpartisan lawyers’ group rating of Leonard Steven Grasz as “not qualified” for the bench was biased. During a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Grasz’s nomination, the Republicans universally praised the Nebraska lawyer, whom Trump wants to fill a vacancy on the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis.  Negative assessments by the American Bar Association, which has been evaluating federal court picks for decades, are rare. It last gave an appeals court nominee a rating of “not qualified” in 2006. That nominee was withdrawn.  The ABA’s 15-member standing committee on the federal judiciary voted unanimously on the poor rating for Grasz, with one member abstaining. The report focused largely on Grasz’s advocacy on conservative social issues, including his opposition to abortion rights. “Many questioned whether Mr. Grasz would be able to detach himself from his deeply held social agenda,” Pamela Bresnahan, chair of the group’s judicial nominee vetting committee, said in a statement. On Wednesday, Republican senators questioned the credibility of the process. “They do a terrific job ordinarily, but sometimes they’re just ridiculous, and in your case I think they’re not only ridiculous, they’ve been political,” Republican Senator Orrin Hatch said, adding he would support Grasz’s appointment.  The dustup over Grasz comes as the full Senate continues to confirm Trump’s judicial choices amid Republican complaints that Democrats are obstructing the process. Ten have been confirmed so far, including Joan Larsen, who was approved on Wednesday to sit on the federal appeals bench in Cincinnati.  The ABA, the largest lawyers group in the United States, says its judicial evaluations are non-partisan, taking into account experience, knowledge of the law and other factors, but not political or ideological views.  As Nebraska’s former chief deputy attorney general, Grasz defended the state’s “partial-birth” abortion ban, among other laws.  Grasz told the senators he would be bound to follow the Supreme Court’s abortion precedents. He said that during the second interview by the ABA, “I was asked repeatedly for my personal opinions on social issues including abortion.” Nebraska Senator Deb Fischer, a Republican, called the ABA rating a “baseless political character assassination.” She claimed the two main evaluators both had ties with Democrats.  Bresnahan declined comment on Wednesday. She will testify before the Judiciary Committee on Nov. 15. ",Republicans defend Trump court pick rated 'not qualified'
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"LONDON, (Reuters) - Two influential U.S. Congressmen have asked the World Health Organization’s cancer agency to get ready to testify about its work assessing if substances cause cancer, citing concerns about its “scientific integrity”. Their letter to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), seen by Reuters and sent on Wednesday, is part of ongoing investigations by two Congressional committees into IARC that were fueled by the agency’s review of glyphosate, the primary ingredient of Monsanto Co’s weedkiller Roundup. A letter to IARC director Chris Wild from the Republican chairmen of the House Committee on Science and the Subcommittee on Environment said they are “concerned about the scientific integrity” of IARC’s “monograph” program, which assesses whether various substances can cause cancer in people. IARC, a semi-autonomous part of the WHO based in Lyon, France, has in recent years assessed whether substances as diverse as coffee, mobile phones and processed meat cause cancer - reports that have all caused controversy. A spokeswoman for IARC said she could not immediately comment on whether the letter had been received. IARC says its methods are scientifically sound and its monographs are “widely respected for their scientific rigor, standardized and transparent process and ... freedom from conflicts of interest”.    In a second letter seen by Reuters, the Congressmen, Lamar Smith and Andy Biggs, expressed concern that IARC’s assessment meetings, deliberations and drafts are not made public.  “It is an affront to scientific integrity to keep ‘confidential’ a scientific process that directly influences policy and individual taxpayers,” Smith and Biggs wrote.   “With United States’ taxpayer dollars funding (part of the monograph program), it is this (Science) Committee’s duty to ensure sound science and transparency within the agency.” Citing data from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), the letter to Wild said that since 1985, IARC has received more than $48 million from NIH, more than $22 million of which went to the monographs program. It added that Smith’s Committee on Science, Space and Technology may soon hold a hearing to receive testimony from IARC on how it conducts its reviews. It asked Wild to provide “names and contact information of IARC-affiliated individuals who would serve as potential witnesses for this hearing”. The second letter, sent on Wednesday to acting U.S. Health Secretary Eric Hargan, asked his department to provide “all documents and communications between or among members of the IARC monograph program and any research institutes or agencies within HHS.” In this letter, the lawmakers said their aim was to understand the extent to which the taxpayer-funded National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences and the National Institutes of Health are involved with IARC’s monograph process. This is “to ensure scientific integrity and an honest use of taxpayer dollars”, the letter said.  In an assessment in 2015 that put it at odds with many government regulators, including those in the United States, Europe and Japan, IARC classified glyphosate as “probably carcinogenic”.          A Reuters investigation in October found that a draft of a key section of IARC’s assessment of glyphosate underwent significant changes before the report was made public. Reuters also reported in June on how the chairman of the IARC glyphosate panel was aware of new data showing no link between the weed-killer and cancer in humans, but the agency did not take it into account because it had not been published. The Congressional committee letters cited these Reuters investigations as well as other media reports, saying they revealed “troubling evidence” about the way IARC operates. In the letters, Smith and Biggs asked IARC to respond by Nov. 8, and the department of Health and Human Services to respond by Nov. 15.

Asked what kind of information he was discussing, Thae said background about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, like his birth date, to convey the idea that he and his family ‘are not gods.” He said South Korean videos, for example were increasingly available within the North.  “The U.S. is spending billions of dollars to cope with the military threat and yet how much does the U.S. spend each year on information activities involving North Korea in a year? Unfortunately, it may be a tiny fraction,” he said. Thae made his first visit to Washington during rising international tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missiles program. The crisis is expected to dominate Trump’s trip to the region, which includes a stop in South Korea. Thae also told the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee that U.S. officials should meet with Kim at least once to try to understand his thinking and convince him that he is risking mass destruction. Thae said Kim thinks he can force the United States to accept North Korea as a nuclear power and drive U.S. forces off the Korean peninsula. Reuters reported on Tuesday that Washington was quietly pursuing direct diplomacy with North Korea, despite Trump’s public assertion that such talks are a waste of time. Amid a war of words between Kim, who has called Trump a “mentally deranged dotard,” and Trump, who referred to Kim as “little rocket man,” many U.S. lawmakers have been pushing for non-military solutions to the crisis. Representative Ed Royce, the committee’s Republican chairman, called at the hearing for a “dramatic increase” in the number of individuals and entities targeted for sanctions, without delay. Thae is the highest-level defector from North Korea in two decades. In emotional testimony, he described a life before he left for South Korea that mixed relative privilege and oppression.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As Americans began signing up for Obamacare health insurance plans on Wednesday, experts expected reduced participation as a bitter political debate clouds the program’s future.      Republicans in Congress have repeatedly failed to repeal and replace former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they have said drives up costs for consumers and interferes with personal medical decisions. Democrats have warned that repeal would leave millions of Americans without health coverage.  President Donald Trump promised to kill Obama’s Affordable Care Act in his 2016 election campaign, and has taken steps to undermine a law he has declared “dead” and “imploding”. Trump’s administration cut Obamacare advertising by 90 percent and shortened the enrollment period by half.  “The market’s going to be extremely confusing. There’s going to be entire complexity of choice,” said David Anderson, a health policy researcher at Duke University.  Obama took to social media on Wednesday, encouraging Americans who need insurance to sign up on the federal Healthcare.gov website. He stressed that government tax credits would keep coverage affordable for most.  Obama asked people to get out the word, “because this country works best when we look out for one another.” A new Trump ad, paid for by the Republican National Committee, blamed Democrats for Obamacare’s “skyrocketing” insurance premiums and for blocking efforts to repeal the law.      Obamacare advocates have warned that sign-ups for individual insurance coverage under the law could drop by about one million people in 2018 compared with 2017. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that four million fewer people will sign up for Obamacare private insurance than previously forecast due to Trump policies.  Still, CBO expects total enrollment to reach 11 million in 2018, up from the around 10 million who obtained and paid for coverage in 2017. Administration officials could not immediately say when 2018 enrollment data would be made public.  The Trump administration has cut the 2018 enrollment period in half to six weeks from Nov. 1 to Dec. 15 for states using the federal Healthcare.gov website. Enrollment previously ran until Jan. 31, and many consumers tended to sign up in the last two weeks, according to state officials and organizations that help people choose insurance. The administration has also cut off billions of dollars in subsidies that insurers use to discount out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income Americans and cut funding to groups that help people enroll in health insurance.  Several insurers have exited Obamacare markets due to concerns over subsidies and other Trump actions. Those that remained raised monthly premium prices to account for the lost government subsidies. Senate Republicans and Democrats are working on legislation to stabilize Obamacare markets in the short term, including restoring the subsidies. But Trump has sought more far-reaching changes, and urged Republicans to take up full-scale repeal again in the coming months.      The Department of Health and Human Services said on Monday that premiums for the most popular Obamacare plans would rise 37 percent in 2018. Americans eligible for Obamacare tax credits to buy insurance may pay less for coverage, but middle-class consumers who do not get subsidies will face much higher prices for these plans. “It’s been such a flood of information. A lot of the population thinks the Affordable Care Act has already been put under,” said Daniel Polsky, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and executive director of the Leonard Davis Institute of Health Economics. “The strange premium increases are going to be very confusing for consumers.” The Trump administration is now planning changes for 2019. Last week, it proposed a rule giving states more flexibility over the benefits that must be covered by insurance. Under Obamacare, all insurers have to cover a set of 10 benefits, such as maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.  ",Obamacare 2018 enrollment clouded by uncertainty under Trump

Manafort and associate Rick Gates pose a significant flight risk because of the serious nature of the charges, the strong evidence of guilt, their wealth and “their history of deceptive and misleading conduct,” federal prosecutors said in a filing Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. Manafort, 68, and Gates, who also worked on Trump’s campaign, pleaded not guilty on Monday in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The charges came as part of federal special counsel Robert Mueller’s 5-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor and potential collusion by campaign aides. The allegations are not related to campaign activities but reveal close ties to Russia, and include activities from 2006 to 2017, which overlaps with the mens’ work on Trump’s campaign. The two men are under house arrest and have relinquished their U.S. passports, with a $10 million bond set for Manafort and a $5 million bond for Gates. “Both defendants have substantial ties abroad, including in Ukraine, where both have spent time and have served as agents of its government,” according to the government’s memorandum in support of the conditions of release.  “And both Manafort and Gates have connections to Ukrainian and Russian oligarchs, who have provided millions of dollars to Manafort and Gates.”  The next hearing in the case, set for 2 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday, will concern the bail conditions that were set at Monday’s arraignment. Manafort was a longtime U.S. Republican operative before turning his attention to political consulting overseas. He submitted 10 passport application in the last decade and currently holds three U.S. passports, the memo said. It is rare but legal to hold three valid passports. People can apply for more than one passport under limited circumstances, including when a foreign country will deny entry to someone holding a passport showing travel to certain other countries or when a visa request is being processed but a  person needs a valid passport for immediate travel, a State Department official said on Wednesday. The official could not comment on Manafort’s passport records but said requests for more than one valid passport are reviewed on a case-by-case basis. Asked about the information in the memo, Manafort lawyer Jason Maloni told Reuters on Wednesday his client “looks forward to having these allegations tried before a judge and jury.” The memo said Manafort’s financial assets were substantial but difficult to quantify because he listed figures on loan applications and other financial documents since 2012 that ranged from $19 million to $136 million. Manafort and Gates owned or controlled entities and accounts worldwide including in Cyprus, Grenadines, Seychelles and England, it said.      Manafort traveled to Mexico, China and Ecuador in 2017, prosecutors said. ","Court document shows Manafort wealth, ties to Russian oligarchs"

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives will delay the release of long-awaited tax legislation by one day until Thursday, the head of the chamber’s tax-writing panel said late on Tuesday. “In consultation with President Trump and our leadership team, we have decided to release the bill text on Thursday,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady said in a statement. “We are pleased with the progress we are making and we remain on schedule to take action and approve a bill at our Committee beginning next week,” the Republican lawmaker added. In a tweet on Tuesday night before Brady’s statement, President Donald Trump said: “The Republican House members are working hard (and late) toward the Massive Tax Cuts that they know you deserve. These will be biggest ever!” Republicans, who control both chambers of Congress, are looking to tax reform for their first legislative victory since Trump took office in January. Democrats say the Trump tax plan is a giveaway to corporations and the rich. Two sources with knowledge of the discussions said earlier on Tuesday that the bill, which had been expected on Wednesday, would emerge a day later to give lawmakers additional time to address differences over the tax treatment of retirement savings accounts and a deduction for state and local tax payments. Trump and other top Republicans have proposed a plan that would cut taxes for corporations, small businesses and individuals by up to $6 trillion over a decade and pay for the reductions in part by eliminating trillions of dollars in deductions and other tax breaks that are often fiercely defended. The U.S. tax code has not undergone a major overhaul since 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was president.  Earlier on Tuesday, House Republicans appeared to be nearing a deal on state and local taxes that would preserve a federal deduction for property taxes but not income taxes, potentially removing a major obstacle. Republican Representative Tom Reed of New York said the “sweet spot” compromise was gaining support among high-tax state lawmakers who have signaled their opposition to a proposal to repeal the state and local tax, or SALT, deduction. Another New York Republican saw things differently. “I’m still inclined to be opposed to it. The income tax is a major factor,” said Representative Peter King. “This is going to affect our country for the next 20 years, for good or bad. I think the last time we did tax reform, there was like two years of debate. We’re going to have 10 days,” he said. The SALT compromise would reduce, but not eliminate, a disproportional tax impact on upper middle-class families in high-income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. Those states send enough Republicans to Congress to derail a tax bill. The House bill is expected to cut the top corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent and phase out the estate tax paid by the wealthiest taxpayers over two or three years. It may also set a repatriation rate for U.S. businesses with profits overseas, according to a source familiar with a Tuesday meeting between House Speaker Paul Ryan and conservative groups. It is also likely to set a 15 percent minimum tax on active foreign income of U.S. corporations, according to lobbyists with knowledge of negotiations. As the Trump administration escalated its pro-tax plan campaign, Vice President Mike Pence met with Republicans on Tuesday, while Trump hosted industry leaders and then Ryan, at the White House. Trump said at the White House he wanted Congress to pass tax reform bills by the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on Nov. 23. A proposal to limit how much money Americans can direct to their 401(k) retirement accounts and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) on a pre-tax basis is meeting resistance, including from fund managers who handle 54 million such accounts. Republicans initially proposed capping tax-free 401(k) contributions at $2,400, down from $18,000 in 2017, but the figure is in flux. “We are either going to strengthen the 401(k)’s and IRA’s so people can save more, or we will leave them as is,” Brady told reporters. Senator Heidi Heitkamp, one of a few Democrats being courted by Republicans, said she could not support lowering the cap on tax-free retirement contributions. “I will not vote for that,” she told reporters.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. senators on Tuesday pressed Facebook Inc’s chief lawyer on why the company did not catch 2016 election ads bought using Russian rubles, why its investigation of them took so long and how much it knows about its 5 million advertisers. Democrats and Republicans at the Senate crime subcommittee hearing fired questions for much of two hours at Facebook General Counsel Colin Stretch, who said that in retrospect the company should have done more.  “In hindsight, we should have had a broader lens. There are signals we missed,” Stretch said under questioning from Democratic Senator Al Franken about how the company missed political ads bought with Russian money. Stretch called the Russia-based ads “reprehensible” for their political divisiveness. The hearing marked the first time tech executives have appeared publicly before U.S. lawmakers on the Russia matter, and the tone represented a dramatic shift in fortunes for Silicon Valley, which for years has grown accustomed to favorable regulatory treatment in the United States.  Lawyers for Twitter Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google also faced questions at the hearing about how Russians used their services, but Facebook drew the bulk of senators’ ire because of its unique role in targeted marketing on the internet.  Facebook has broader reach than the smaller Twitter network, and it offers more powerful targeting capabilities than Google.  “I suspect that your advertising department has watched the profits go up,” Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy told Stretch, who responded that Facebook was committed to rooting out accounts that use fake names.  Lawyers for the three companies were scheduled to return to Capitol Hill on Wednesday for two more hearings on Russia ad spending.  The Russian government has denied it intended to influence  the 2016 presidential election, in which Republican Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton.   Facebook, in a series of disclosures over two months, has said that people in Russia bought at least 3,000 U.S. political ads and published another 80,000 Facebook posts that were seen by as many as 126 million Americans over two years.  Senators said they could not understand the timing of Facebook’s disclosures.  “Why has it taken Facebook 11 months to come forward and help us understand the scope of this problem?” Democratic Senator Chris Coons asked.  Stretch responded that, when U.S. spy agencies alleged in January that Russians meddled in last year’s election, “we weren’t sitting around.” The company over the following months launched an investigation and reported the results, he said.  Facebook has also announced steps to change how it treats political ads. It said it is hiring 1,000 more people to review ads, compiling a publicly searchable archive of political ads beginning next year and requiring more information about the identity of election advertisers. Coons said he wished the tech companies had sent their top executives on Tuesday rather than in-house lawyers.  Republican Senator John Kennedy told Stretch that he doubted Facebook’s ability to stop people overseas from buying U.S. election ads. U.S. law bars election spending by non-Americans. “You’ve got 5 million advertisers and you’re going to tell me that you’re able to trace the origin of all those advertisements?” Kennedy asked Stretch.  The Facebook lawyer responded that there was little the company could do if a foreign advertiser used a U.S. shell corporation.  Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the crime subcommittee, said he wanted to help the tech companies, but he also pressed Stretch on whether Iran and North Korea could try to do what Russia did in the United States.  Stretch responded: “Certainly potentially. The internet is borderless.”   Hanging over Facebook, Google and Twitter is the threat of legislation that would extend rules governing political advertising on television, radio and satellite to also cover social media.  The companies have responded with proposals for self-regulation, saying they would create their own public archives of election-related ads.  Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar told witnesses on Tuesday that self-regulation would lead to a “patchwork” of databases and that a uniform system would be better for voters.

0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - A California neuroscientist vying to unseat Republican Congressman Dana Rohrabacher stepped up his criticism of the conservative on Tuesday, demanding he return a $1,000 contribution from indicted Trump adviser Paul Manafort. The Orange County seat held by Rohrabacher is key to Democrats’ hopes to increase their numbers in the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s elections. Neuroscientist Hans Keirstead, a stem cell researcher and entrepreneur from Laguna Beach, is one of seven Democrats aiming to beat him, according to the Federal Election Commission. “We’ve got a Russian-tainted Congressman taking Russian-tainted money from Manafort,” Keirstead said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. “Something has to be put straight here.” Federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election on Monday charged Manafort, a lobbyist and former Trump campaign manager, with money laundering. Rohrabacher, a senior member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, has frequently praised Russian President Vladimir Putin and was considered for a role in U.S. President Donald Trump’s cabinet. His Southern California base in Orange County was for decades a Republican stronghold and a center of support for Ronald Reagan. Reliably conservative voters there have sent Rohrabacher to the House for nearly 30 years. But the 48th Congressional district has undergone profound demographic shifts in recent years, and it is now one of nine Republican districts in California that Democrats have targeted. Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the district in 2016, winning 152,000 votes compared to his 146,600. “These are people who care about the environment, care about social issues,” said Drew Godinich, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in California. “Donald Trump and Donald Trump’s Republican Party are no longer a good match for them.” Democrats’ success in the district, however, is far from assured. Despite a tilt toward Clinton for the presidency, voters there chose Rohrabacher over Democrat Suzanne Savary by more than six percentage points in 2016. Through a spokesman, Rohrabacher indicated that he was not at this time prepared to reject Manafort - or the $1,000 donation the political operative made to his 2014 campaign. “The Congressman advises his political opponents and the media to observe the presumption of innocence, still an American principle,” spokesman Ken Grubbs said in an email.

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, the indicted former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. His lavish lifestyle - with homes in Manhattan, Brooklyn, the Hamptons, Arlington, Virginia and elsewhere - were detailed in an indictment filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that was revealed on Monday. The indictment filed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller said Manafort “used his hidden overseas wealth to enjoy a lavish lifestyle in the United States.” Prosecutors said they found payments by Manafort for four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz among transactions that they alleged came illegally from overseas to avoid paying U.S. income taxes, according to the 31-page court filing. Prosecutors said they found evidence he bought a condo in a restored red-brick building in New York’s upscale Soho neighborhood for $2.85 million, also from overseas money, most often from Cyprus.  Manafort and associate Rick Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to money laundering and other charges filed in a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.  Manafort and Gates both appeared stoic throughout a court hearing on Monday. Greg Andres, a federal prosecutor on Mueller’s team, said his office had a “difficult time” trying to pin down Manafort’s and Gates’ net worths, making it hard to set appropriate bail arrangements. Andres said Manafort listed a wide range of net asset values on loans and other financial documents, from as low as $20 million to as high as $100 million. Gates, meanwhile, listed assets as low as $2 million and as high as $30 million. A federal judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. Manafort’s attorney Kevin Downing said on Monday there was no evidence that his client colluded with the Russian government while working for the Trump campaign. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment. Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine. The indictment said both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities. The indictment said he spent $849,215 in a men’s clothing store in New York and $520,440 at one in Beverly Hills. He spent $5,434,793 on a house in Water Mill, New York, in Long Island’s Hamptons, shelling out $820,240 for landscaping. Aerial photos of the place show gardens, a pool, a tennis court, a basketball court and a putting green and sand trap on 2.37 acres (0.96 hectare). A seven-bedroom Brooklyn brownstone, which he bought for $3 million, was described in a real estate agent’s listing as “dripping with detail - perfectly intact crown moldings and medallions, gold leafed carved window detail, 5 marble mantels, and original Lincrusta paper wall covering.” ","Manafort spent millions on homes, rugs, clothes: court filing"
0,True,"November 1, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who met with Donald Trump Jr. during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, wants permission to return to the United States to defend a claim by prosecutors that her client’s company has failed to pay a $6 million settlement in an international money laundering case. Veselnitskaya represented Prevezon Holdings Ltd, a Russian-controlled company, which in May this year agreed to pay nearly $6 million to the U.S. government to settle a $230 million  Russian tax fraud case related to Hermitage Capital, an American fund that invested in Russia.     In a court filing in federal court in Manhattan on Monday U.S. prosecutors said the settlement payment was due on Oct. 31, but in a letter on Tuesday filed in federal court in Manhattan  lawyers for Prevezon disagreed. About half of the settlement money was supposed to come from 3 million euros owed to Prevezon that the U.S. government had asked the Netherlands to freeze.  The Netherlands lifted the hold on the money on October 10, but the same day imposed a new freeze on the account based on a complaint by William Browder, chief executive of Hermitage Capital Management, the Prevezon letter said. In Monday’s court filing, U.S. prosecutors said the $6 million payment was due regardless of the new freeze on the funds and they intended to file a motion to enforce the settlement.  In its letter, Prevezon asked the court to help obtain temporary U.S. immigration status for Veselnitskaya and its owner, Denis Katsyv, so she could attend upcoming hearings about the dispute.  Veselnitskaya met Donald Trump Jr in New York last year while she was in the United States to represent Prevezon in the money laundering case.  Trump Jr. said in a statement at the time that he and Veselnitskaya “primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children” after Russia in 2012 banned adoptions of Russian children by Americans in retaliation for sanctions imposed under the U.S. Magnitsky Act.  The Magnitsky Act was passed by Congress after Hermitage Capital’s Browder claimed that the tax fraud scheme involving Prevezon was uncovered by Sergei Magnitsky, an auditor for Hermitage Capital, who died in a Russian prison. Trump Jr. has released emails related to the meeting during last year’s election that described Veselnitskaya as a Russian government attorney who could provide information that would “incriminate Hillary and her dealings with Russia and would be very useful to your father.” ",Russian lawyer who met Trump Jr. seeks return to U.S. to defend money laundering settlement
0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A former senior adviser on President Donald Trump’s campaign team, Sam Clovis, sought to distance himself on Tuesday from George Papadopoulos, an ex-campaign aide who has pleaded guilty in the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty earlier this month to lying to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about his dealings with Russians, including an April 2016 meeting in which he was told the Russians had “dirt” on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton that entailed “thousands of emails.” Prosecutors on Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team said in court records that Papadopoulos had conversations and email exchanges with an unnamed “campaign supervisor” about efforts to improve U.S.-Russia relations by setting up meetings between senior campaign and Russian officials. According to those records, the campaign supervisor conveyed to Papadopoulos in a March 6, 2016, discussion that “a principal foreign policy focus of the campaign was an improved U.S. relationship with Russia.” A source familiar with the investigation said Clovis was the campaign supervisor referenced in the court records. Victoria Toensing, a lawyer for Clovis, did not dispute that but added that her client never said improving U.S.-Russia relations was a “principal foreign policy focus” because that was not his view of Trump’s priorities. Mueller is leading a probe into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides. Russia denies the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Prosecutors said in the court records that Papadopoulos emailed the supervisor and several others to tell them he had met with a professor who had in turn introduced him to a Russian woman and the Russian ambassador in London, and that they discussed setting up meetings to talk about U.S.-Russia ties in a Trump presidency. The supervisor replied that he would “work it through the campaign” and not to make a commitment at that point. “Great work,” the supervisor added in the email. In August 2016, the supervisor wrote to Papadopoulos in reference to a possible “off the record” meeting with Russian officials, saying: “I would encourage you” and another foreign policy adviser “to make the trip.” In her response, Toensing said: “Dr. Clovis always vigorously opposed any Russian trip for Donald Trump or staff. However, if a volunteer made suggestions on any foreign policy matter, Dr. Clovis, a polite gentleman from Iowa, would have expressed courtesy and appreciation.” Clovis has since been nominated by Trump to a top post as chief scientist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Debbie Stabenow, the ranking member of the Senate panel that will vet the nomination, told Reuters she was concerned. “The emerging information about his role in the Trump campaign’s interactions with Russia raises serious concerns,” she said in a statement. NBC News reported on Tuesday that Clovis had been questioned by Mueller’s team and testified before the grand jury. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said on Tuesday that Trump’s campaign team provided the special counsel with emails involving Papadopoulos, and described it as a case of an individual doing the “wrong thing” while the campaign did the “right thing.”   ",Former Trump campaign adviser denies encouraging aide on Russia dealings
0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump brushed off the first indictments in the probe of his campaign’s ties to Russian election meddling, but the charges sent a clear signal to the White House and other Trump associates: Robert Mueller means business. By going after Trump’s campaign manager and another aide on money-laundering charges and securing a guilty plea from a third campaign adviser, the special prosecutor showed he would delve deeply into the past in search of criminal activity and use his broad powers aggressively. That left some Trump associates worried about what or whom Mueller would target next, despite the White House’s public dismissal of the developments as unrelated to the president and his campaign. “They’re flexing their muscles for anybody that they approach in this investigation and letting them know we really mean it,” said former federal prosecutor Patrick Cotter. “So if we come to you, you should talk to us. Manafort didn’t and look what happened to him.” Manafort and Rick Gates are charged with money laundering, tax fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and other counts. They pleaded not guilty on Monday. The indictments, which closely detail the alleged crimes, appeared to be an opening salvo from Mueller. He was appointed by U.S. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in May after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who had led an investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Mueller was given a mandate to probe potential collusion and “any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.” Trump has denied any collusion with Russia and at times described the investigation as a “hoax” and a “witch hunt.”     Russia has denied interfering with the 2016 election. With the first indictments on Monday, Mueller showed he was not afraid to use his powers, and Trump officials noticed. “One thing I’m worried about in a bigger scale is that Rosenstein, by giving Mueller this wide berth, has created this monster,” said one former White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.  A former Trump campaign adviser fretted that the probe could, as a result, touch on Trump’s businesses, too.  In a New York Times interview in July, Trump indicated that Mueller would be crossing a red line if he investigated Trump’s family business.     Legal experts said Mueller would not be swayed by Trump’s view of the proper scope of the investigation. “I don’t think prosecutors concern themselves with what politicians say about red lines being drawn,” said former federal prosecutor Robert Capers. Jens David Ohlin, a professor of criminal law at Cornell Law School, said Mueller could be targeting alleged financial crimes by Manafort and Gates to gain their cooperation and uncover wrongdoing elsewhere. A number of lawyers said the guilty plea of George Papadopoulos, announced by Mueller’s team on Monday, could ultimately provide a closer link to the campaign and pressure others to open up. While the charges against Manafort and Gates were not related to their campaign work, Papadopoulos admitted he lied to the Federal Bureau of Investigation about his contacts with foreign nationals he believed to be tied to the Russian government while he was a campaign adviser. Prosecutors said they arrested Papadopoulos in July and that he was cooperating with the government.  “God knows what this guy’s going to say now,” said the former Trump campaign adviser. “Since he’s cooperating, he could set any perjury traps up for others.” Cotter said Mueller’s unveiling of Papadopoulos’ guilty plea “was to head off any arguments that the case against Manafort and Gates is not about Russia.”  Frank Montoya, a former senior FBI agent, said Manafort’s indictment and Papadopoulos’ plea indicated Mueller was not going to bow to White House pressure and would keep pushing hard to uncover wrongdoing. “It is pretty much a road map – we are going to be looking at the money laundering, we are going to be looking at the failure to report income, we are going to be looking at the general criminal conspiracies. This is also about Trump’s red line – we are going to cross it. And we are going to keep looking at the so-called collusion, or the coordination with the Russians to undermine democracy,” Montoya said. ","In Russia probe, Mueller's first charges a show of force"

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Representative Jeb Hensarling, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee, announced on Tuesday that he would retire from Congress at the end of 2018, marking the exit of Congress’s leading advocate for rolling back strict financial rules. Hensarling, 60, of Texas, said in a statement that he would not seek re-election, noting that his term as head of the banking panel expires at the same time. He has been a vocal proponent of significant deregulation in the financial sector and an author of sweeping legislation to drastically reduce the regulations imposed on banks. “Today I am announcing that I will not seek re-election to the U.S. Congress in 2018,” Hensarling said in a statement. “Although service in Congress remains the greatest privilege of my life, I never intended to make it a lifetime commitment, and I have already stayed far longer than I had originally planned.” Hensarling, first elected to Congress in 2002, had been the architect of a broad rewrite of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. The overall would have eliminated several of the major powers given to regulators after the 2007-2009 financial crisis and impose strict new limitations on their authority. That bill, the Financial CHOICE Act, is not expected to become law after passing the House, due to insufficient support in the Senate. But his work was hailed by GOP colleagues as an ambitious effort to cut regulation of the banking industry. “Jeb has eloquently articulated this conservative vision, leading the charge to repeal Dodd-Frank and deliver a freer market that gives every American the opportunity to achieve the American dream,” said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy in a statement. Banking lobby groups, including the Financial Services Roundtable and American Bankers Association, said Hensarling had been a strong leader who advanced reforms that led to economic opportunity and better banking. He has been a steadfast critic of rules imposed on the financial sector after the crash, and became an industry ally in efforts to roll them back. But those efforts also made him a top target of advocates of stricter rules, who said his efforts would put Americans at risk of a similar meltdown. “Hensarling has probably just decided to spend more time with his banks. We hope the revolving door doesn’t hit him too hard on the way out,” said Karl Frisch, executive director of Allied Progress. While some GOP lawmakers have announced plans to retire after facing uphill re-election battles, Hensarling hails from a deeply conservative district in Texas where he remains highly popular. In 2016, he faced no Republican rivals in the party’s primary and took 80.6 percent of the district’s vote in the general election. Even though the district consistently votes Republican, his resignation will provide another opportunity for Democrats to realize their hopes of taking control of the House in 2018. Lawyer Dan Wood, has already entered the race to be the party’s nominee for the seat. Unlike some exiting Republicans, Hensarling never publicly feuded with President Donald Trump. In fact, Trump had considered Hensarling for a post in his administration after the election. His exit will set off a competition to take over as head of the powerful banking committee. Representative Patrick McHenry is the vice chair of the committee, but Representatives Blaine Luetkemeyer, Bill Huizenga, and Sean Duffy are also potential contenders, according to lobbyists familiar with the committee. One lobbyist said Luetkemeyer was the leading candidate to lead the panel, as McHenry is seen as a rising star in House leadership. Luetkemeyer is “seriously considering” running for the chairmanship, according to his spokeswoman. Hensarling’s next move is unclear. Some lobbyists speculated he could take a top role at a conservative think tank like the Heritage Foundation. Alternatively, he could take a role in the administration or return to his home state. Cowen and Co analyst Jaret Seiberg said in a client note that Hensarling could be “the top contender” to take over the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The current FHFA Director, Mel Watt, is an appointee of former President Barack Obama, serving out a term that expires in January of 2019.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Modernizing and maintaining the U.S. nuclear arsenal over the next 30 years will cost more than $1.2 trillion, according to a report released on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office. The report said current plans for the modernization of the aging planes, ships and missile silos that make up the U.S. nuclear arsenal would cost 50 percent more than if the U.S. only operated and maintained its current equipment in the field. The CBO study reviewed the Obama’s Administration’s plans for modernization of the nuclear arsenal. President Donald Trump in January directed Secretary of Defense James Mattis to conduct his own review the U.S. nuclear forces. The results could be published in the coming months.  U.S. House Armed Services Committee member Adam Smith, a Democrat from Washington, said of the Obama-era plan: “Congress still doesn’t seem to have any answers as to how we will pay for this effort, or what the trade-offs with other national security efforts will be.”  The report said costs would rise from $29 billion in 2017 to $47 billion in 2027, before peaking at around $50 billion a year through the early 2030s. Trump has said he wants to ensure the U.S. nuclear arsenal is at the “top of the pack,” saying the United States has fallen behind in its weapons capacity. U.S. officials have noted that America’s nuclear modernization is lagging behind Russia’s upgrade of its own nuclear triad. General Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress in August he believed Moscow was already two-thirds of the way through its nuclear modernization process. In August, the U.S. Air Force awarded Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp separate contracts to continue development work on the replacement of the aging Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile system one leg of the nuclear triad.  Days later the Air Force awarded Lockheed Martin Corp and Raytheon Co separate $900 million contracts to continue work on a replacement for the AGM-86B air-launched nuclear cruise missile.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leading Republicans in the U.S. Senate, expressing frustration at how slowly President Donald Trump’s nominees are being confirmed, on Tuesday called for changes in the chamber’s procedures to speed up the approval process. “I believe it is time to change the rules of the Senate,” Senate Republican Policy Committee Chair John Barrasso told reporters, saying a way needed to be found to shorten debate times. Trump has complained bitterly about Senate rules slowing progress on his agenda. But the president has generally focused his criticism on a Senate rule that requires 60 votes for most legislation to advance in the 100-member chamber - the so-called filibuster rule. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said that Republicans do not want to change the 60-vote requirement for legislation. But McConnell, speaking to reporters after Barrasso on Tuesday, said there may be a way to reduce the time spent on debating judicial and other nominees after they clear an initial hurdle. Currently that time is capped at 30 hours. Republicans have repeatedly complained that Democrats are using the time allowance to drag out confirmation of Trump’s nominees. “Due to the Democrats’ obstruction, this administration has had the lowest percentage of nominees confirmed of any administration in the past 30 years,” Barrasso said in a news release. At this point in Democratic then-President Bill Clinton’s term, Clinton had 76 percent of his nominees confirmed, and Democratic then-President Barack Obama had 67 percent, while Trump has had fewer than 40 percent, Barrasso said. Barrasso suggested the Senate might want to revive a bipartisan agreement from a previous Congress. It allowed debate on Supreme Court nominees and Cabinet members to last up to 30 hours, but other categories of nominees got less: either eight or two hours. Two other senior Republicans, Senators John Cornyn and Roy Blunt, suggested Republicans could change the rules unilaterally if Democrats are not interested in negotiating a change. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer sidestepped a question on the matter. “Senator McConnell does not come to the floor with clean hands on these issues. He delayed and blocked so many of Obama’s nominees, in fact many of the judges they’re now filling should have been filled by Obama nominees,” Schumer told reporters. Earlier this year, McConnell moved to scrap the 60-vote hurdle on Supreme Court nominations to clear the way for confirming Neil Gorsuch to the court. Previously, when Democrats ran the Senate, they ended the 60-vote hurdle on other executive branch nominations. ",U.S. Senate Republicans want to speed Trump nominee approvals
0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House Chief of Staff John Kelly’s comment that the U.S. Civil War was sparked by a lack of “compromise” drew criticism and reignited a debate over Confederate monuments and the role of slavery. In an interview on Monday night with Fox News, Kelly was asked whether a Virginia church should have removed plaques honoring Confederate General Robert E. Lee and President George Washington, both Virginians. Kelly said figures of the past could not be viewed through the lens of current moral values. “I think it’s just very, very dangerous and it shows you ... how much of a lack of appreciation of history and what history is,” Kelly said. “I will tell you that Robert E. Lee was an honorable man.” “The lack of an ability to compromise led to the Civil War, and men and women of good faith on both sides made their stand where their conscience had them make their stand,” Kelly added. The comment sparked an immediate backlash, with critics noting that the United States had made a number of compromises on slavery before tensions eventually erupted into the war between the North and the South in 1861. “Notion that Civil War resulted from a lack of compromise is belied by all the compromises made on enslavement from America’s founding,” Ta-Nehisi Coates, an African-American writer, wrote on Twitter. Others accused Kelly of encouraging white supremacists by saying Lee was honorable. “It’s irresponsible & dangerous, especially when white supremacists feel emboldened, to make fighting to maintain slavery sound courageous,” Bernice King, the daughter of American civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr., wrote in a Twitter post. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders, asked on Tuesday about Kelly’s comment, told a news briefing: “General Kelly was simply making the point that just because history isn’t perfect, it doesn’t mean that it’s not our history.” Replying to another question about whether figures such as  Nathan Bedford Forrest, a Confederate general accused of war crimes and an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan, deserved to be honored, Sanders said: “The president has said that those are something that should be left up to state and local governments, and that’s not who I’m here representing today.”  President Donald Trump has said Confederate monuments, many of which have been removed in recent years, should remain in place to preserve the country’s heritage.  He stirred tensions after a deadly rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville, Virginia, by insisting that counterprotesters were also to blame, drawing condemnation from some Republican leaders and praise from white supremacists. Kelly had a distinguished military career and led the Department of Homeland Security before Trump tapped him to be chief of staff.  Kelly is viewed by some as a moderating influence in the turbulent White House, but has also stepped into controversy. Earlier this month, he attacked a Florida congresswoman who had characterized a call between Trump and a military widow who lost her husband in Niger as disrespectful.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, proposed a bill on Tuesday to overhaul disclosure rules regarding anyone working on behalf of a foreign government, a law that has received renewed attention after Paul Manafort was indicted for violating it.  The proposed legislation, called the Disclosing Foreign Influence Act, would close loopholes in the Foreign Agents Registration Act and require the Department of Justice to develop a strategy for enforcing the law, the Republican senator said in a statement.  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative who briefly served as Donald Trump’s campaign manager in 2016, and his business associate Rick Gates, pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The current law, known as FARA, requires persons acting on behalf of a foreign government or political party to disclose to the Department of Justice their work as well as public communications taken on behalf of that client.  Critics have argued the reporting requirements for FARA are unclear and contains loopholes that allow American lobbyists to avoid disclosure of their foreign clients. “Congress passed the Foreign Agents Registration Act to prevent inappropriate influence in domestic policy, but my oversight work has uncovered rampant disregard by foreign agents and lackluster enforcement by federal authorities,” Grassley said in a statement.   The proposed law would clarify who is required to register, improve investigative tools, including granting authority for the Justice Department to pursue civil charges, and create new reporting requirements. FARA was first passed in 1938 in the lead up to World War II in an effort to combat German propaganda efforts and was later amended in 1966 to include lobbyists, according to the Department of Justice. As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Grassley is empowered to see that the bill quickly receives a hearing and a vote. ",Senior Republican proposes more oversight of foreign lobbying

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Tuesday it will bar certain scientists from serving on its independent advisory boards, a move critics say could open the way to more industry-friendly advisors on the panels. The EPA barred scientists who have won agency-awarded grants in the past, billing the step as a way to preserve the independence and diversity of the boards, which provide the scientific input for agency decisions around pollution and climate change regulation. “Whatever science comes out of EPA, (it) shouldn’t be political science,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, said in a release, adding that committee members will be “financially independent” from the agency.  Senator Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Senate environment committee, said Pruitt’s decision was part of an EPA effort to “delegitimize the work of nonpartisan scientists.” Carper added, “this crusade endangers the health of every American, and it cannot be tolerated.” Pruitt signaled the move during a speech last week at the conservative Heritage Foundation, when he questioned the independence of scientists who have won past EPA research grants, and promised to “fix” the situation. During his election campaign last year, Republican President Donald Trump promised to roll back environmental regulations from Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration, including those limiting carbon dioxide emissions blamed for global warming, to make government more friendly to the drilling, mining, and manufacturing businesses.     The advisory boards were created by Congress to serve as a check on EPA policies and research. They include the EPA Scientific Advisory Board, the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, and the Board of Scientific Counselors.  Last year, the SAB questioned an EPA report that concluded that hydraulic fracturing - an oil and gas drilling technology that frees petroleum from underground shale formations - had no ""widespread impacts"" on drinking water despite evidence of problems in several states. (reut.rs/2h2GTrD) In June, Pruitt decided not to renew the terms of nine members of a separate body, the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors. One of those members, Michigan State University professor of community sustainability Robert Richardson, told Reuters the move came as a surprise because the work they were doing was “apolitical.”     The EPA is also expected to announce three new members of the Clean Air advisory committee on Tuesday. Pruitt is an outspoken doubter of mainstream climate science, a consensus of scientists that carbon dioxide from human use of fossil fuels is a primary driver of global warming, triggering more frequent volatile storms, sea level rise, and droughts.  Pruitt has said he wants to set up a televised debate about the science of climate change between scientists who believe it is driven by humans and those that do not.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. senators introduced a bill on Tuesday they said would prevent President Donald Trump from launching a nuclear first strike on North Korea on his own, highlighting the issue days before the Republican’s first presidential trip to Asia. The measure would stop Trump, or any U.S. president, from launching an attack on North Korea, or spending any money on a military strike, without congressional approval, unless North Korea has first attacked the United States. Tensions between Washington and Pyongyang have been building after a series of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea and bellicose verbal exchanges between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. The CIA has said North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with a nuclear weapon, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent. “I worry that the president’s enthusiasm will not be checked by the advisers around him,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy, the legislation’s lead sponsor, told reporters on a conference call. Some Republicans have also expressed concern about Trump’s rhetoric, but none co-sponsored the bill, which is backed by seven Democrats and Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent. Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House, and there has been no indication that congressional leaders would allow a vote. Similar measures introduced earlier this year have also failed to advance. However, backers said they might try to pass it later this year by introducing it as an amendment to legislation such as a  as a must-pass spending bill. “I have confidence that if this came to a vote on the floor of the Senate, it would prevail,” Murphy said. Lawmakers have been trying to take back more control over foreign policy from the White House. Congress passed a bill in July barring the president from lifting sanctions on Russia without lawmakers’ approval, and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Monday held a hearing on a new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, to exert some authority over the campaign against Islamic State and other militant groups. At that hearing, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis said Trump does not have the authority to use force against North Korea without an imminent threat, but they did not define what such a threat would be.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday that U.S. charges against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide showed Moscow had been unfairly maligned in accusations that it meddled in last year’s U.S. presidential election. Federal investigators probing alleged Russian interference in the election, something Moscow denies, charged Manafort and Rick Gates with money laundering on Monday. But despite being brought as part of a five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favor and into potential collusion by Trump aides, the charges, some going back over a decade, centered on Manafort’s work for Ukraine’s former government, not Russia’s. That was welcomed in Russia, where officials are watching the investigation closely since public evidence of Russian meddling, something that has not so far been presented, would be sure to translate into tougher U.S. sanctions against Moscow. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov highlighted the absence of allegations against Russia in the indictment against Manafort and Gates, saying on Tuesday that Moscow had always said it had never interfered in the U.S. election. That assertion is challenged by U.S. intelligence agencies  who say unequivocally that Moscow did interfere in the November 2016 vote. “...Russia does not feature in the charges that were leveled in any way. Other countries and other people feature (in the charges),” Peskov told a conference call with reporters. “Moscow never felt itself guilty so it doesn’t feel  exonerated now,” he said, when asked whether the Kremlin interpreted the indictment as proof that its repeated denials about meddling election were true. Peskov also brushed aside any suggestion that someone with links to the Russian Foreign Ministry might have tried to set up a meeting with the Trump campaign through a third ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, who it was announced on Monday pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI.  Russia’s flagship TV news show took a similar line on Monday evening, saying it was “now clear that there was nothing” to allegations about Manafort being in touch with Russian officials to try to sway the election.     The U.S. investigation was an internal matter for the United States, said Peskov, but Moscow was following it with interest. Peskov laughed off the purported role of Papadopoulos, who told investigators he had tried to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Russian leadership. In his unsuccessful quest to broker such a meeting, Papadopoulos said he had met a London-based professor boasting of contacts with Russian officials and an unnamed Russian woman. He also mentioned being in touch with someone linked to the Russian Foreign Ministry. Peskov, when asked what the Kremlin made of someone linked to the Foreign Ministry allegedly trying to set up a Putin-Trump meeting, said: “It’s an absolutely laughable allegation.” Media reports have suggested the individual linked to the ministry is Ivan Timofeev, who works for a Moscow-based think-tank called the Russian International Relations Council (RIAC).  Timofeev did not respond to a request for comment, but told the gazeta.ru online news portal in August that Papadopoulos had emailed him in the spring of 2016 and spoken about the possibility of organizing a Trump trip to Russia. Timofeev said Papadopoulos had never made a formal request to either RIAC or the Russian Foreign Ministry for such a visit, however, and that he had got the impression that he had been “acting on his own initiative” and was “an enthusiast with little experience.” Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told reporters on Tuesday that there was nothing “illegal” about Papadopoulos contacting someone at RIAC.

Charges filed by Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller alleged Manafort and business partner Rick Gates failed to properly disclose lobbying for a foreign government. After the indictment was made public, Washington lobbyist Tony Podesta, a longtime powerbroker, stepped down from the firm bearing his name as the company came under scrutiny in the investigation for work it did with Manafort. “Today is another unnecessary black eye for the lobbying profession,” said Paul Miller, a lobbyist who heads the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics (NILE). “The indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates should send a message to the lobbying profession that this type of activity cannot be tolerated and to Congress that its time to take a hard look at the (Lobbying Disclosure Act).”  Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates pleaded not guilty on Monday to a 12-count indictment that contained  charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. NILE has previously encouraged Congress to close loopholes in the Lobbying Disclosure Act, known as LDA, to make lobbying more transparent by subjecting more activity to disclosure and requiring lobbyists to reveal when an intermediary hires them on behalf of another organization.  Two separate laws require lobbying disclosure: The LDA, which covers domestic interests, and the Foreign Agents Registration Act, under which Manafort was charged and requires disclosure for lobbying on behalf of foreign entities.  “Today, we hear the echoes of crickets when we go to the Hill asking for reforms that will have a direct and immediate impact,” Miller said.

The Securing America’s Voting Equipment, or SAVE, Act is the latest attempt by lawmakers to respond to what U.S. intelligence agencies say was a multi-pronged cyber operation, including hacking and online propaganda by Russia during the 2016 presidential election aimed at helping President Donald Trump. Moscow has repeatedly denied the accusations. The bill will be introduced by Democratic Senator Martin Heinrich and Republican Senator Susan Collins, a Heinrich spokeswoman said. It does not currently have other co-sponsors. “Until we set up stronger protections of our election systems and take the necessary steps to prevent future foreign influence campaigns, our nation’s democratic institutions will remain vulnerable,” Heinrich said in a statement. The SAVE Act would authorize the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to grant security clearance to the top election official in each state in addition to one other designee. It would also allow the DNI to share some classified information with the states about threats to their voting systems. Several state election officials have complained that they were left in the dark about Russia’s attempts to probe their voting systems during the 2016 campaign. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not notify 21 states it said had been targeted by Russian until last month, in part due to confidentiality and classification restrictions.  The DHS in January designated voting systems as a critical part of the nation’s infrastructure, making state elections eligible for more federal protections. The legislation would write that designation into law, and also create a grant program for states to upgrade their systems to better fend off physical and cyber threats. It was not clear whether the bill would gain momentum in an otherwise gridlocked Congress. ",Senators to introduce bill to boost cyber defenses of voting systems

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election charged President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering on Monday.  A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday. It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favour and into potential collusion by Trump aides. Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.  Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million (7.57 million pounds) unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday. The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies. Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia denies the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, centre on Manafort’s work for Ukraine. The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.     A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.  “We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing. Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign. Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government. In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.         Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Clinton.     Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain that stated he had since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document. Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said Papadopoulos’ role in the campaign was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer. “He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said. In a May 4 email quoted in the Papadopoulos indictment, a Trump campaign employee forwarded a message from Papadopoulos proposing a meeting between Trump and the Russian government to another campaign official. The employee included a note, according to the indictment, that read: “Let’s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.” A source in Washington, who did not want to be identified and who has seen the email, said the sender was Manafort and the recipient was Gates. Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.     Trump reiterated his frustration on Monday with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton. Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.  They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said. The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan,  Brooklyn, the Hamptons, Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere. Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz. Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman. ","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty"

A special counsel would be appointed by the Justice Department. Republicans in Congress last week launched an investigation into an Obama-era deal in which a Russian company bought a Canadian firm that owned some 20 percent of U.S. uranium supplies. Some Republicans have said Hillary Clinton’s State Department approved the deal after her husband’s charitable foundation received a $145 million donation. The New York Times has reported that Clinton, a Democrat who lost to Republican Trump in the 2016 election, did not participate in the decision. Republicans have also raised questions about whether Democrats funded a dossier put together during last year’s presidential campaign that detailed accusations about Trump’s ties to Russia.  The Washington Post reported last week that Marc Elias, a lawyer for Clinton, used campaign funds to hire Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier. Kelly’s call for a special counsel to investigate Democrats comes as a probe by special counsel Robert Mueller into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians produced its first charges and a guilty plea.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A top U.S. business lobby in China said on Tuesday it was concerned U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration was not making sufficient preparation for talks on imbalances in the bilateral economic relationship ahead of his November visit. Little advance work has been done for the visit, said William Zarit, chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. He was referring to meetings by working level officials to negotiate outcomes on commercial issues for Trump’s meeting with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. “From what I understand, there really hasn’t been much of that for this visit, which makes us a bit concerned that there may not be much discussion on the structural issues,” Zarit told reporters in Beijing. U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will bring a business delegation to Beijing during Trump’s visit. Some in the U.S. business community are worried that deals announced on the trip could distract from solutions to long-standing complaints over discriminatory Chinese policies and market access restrictions. Zarit said he hoped proposed deals from the business delegation “do not overshadow the real need for structural changes in the economic relationship”. Trump, who will stop in five Asian countries on his first visit to the region as president, will arrive in Beijing on Nov. 8. U.S. officials were “still waiting” for a Chinese response to issues raised during the U.S.-China Comprehensive Economic Dialogue in July, Zarit said, though he did not give specifics. He called Chinese officials “master negotiators” and said the U.S. government and business community had long suffered from a less strategic view of the economic relationship. “And I think there is no exception with this administration,” Zarit said.  He added that it was “not unreasonable” to expect more progress 10 months into Trump’s presidency. Ross, has said the United States will be looking for “immediate results” and “tangible agreements” during Trump’s visit, but has acknowledged that market access, intellectual property rights, and tariffs are more complex and will take a longer time to negotiate. Washington and Beijing launched a 100-day economic plan during Trump’s first meeting with Xi in April, including some industry-specific announcements, such as the resumption of American beef sales in China. But U.S. business groups have expressed disappointment over the extent of the outcomes. Xi vowed on Monday that China would take more measures to open up the economy. He made the remarks at a meeting with members of an advisory board to Tsinghua University’s School of Economics and Management, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O) chief executive Tim Cook and Facebook Inc’s (FB.O) Mark Zuckerberg.  China will make joint efforts with the United States to “take each other’s interests and concerns into consideration, resolve disputes and contradictions, and engage in win-win cooperation”, Xi said according to the official China Daily newspaper. But such frequently made pledges have done little to assuage foreign companies’ concerns over ownership caps in key sectors, such as autos, securities, insurance, and information technology. U.S. business lobbies argue that their members are restricted in those industries while Chinese companies operate freely in the U.S. market. They have also criticized Beijing’s “Made in China 2025” plan, which offers government backing for sectors the Chinese government deems strategic.

0,True,"October 31, 2017 ",politicsNews,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A year-long audit of the program overseeing U.S. labs that handle lethal pathogens such as Ebola and anthrax found overworked safety inspectors, an absence of independent review and weak biosafety protections that could expose lab workers and the public to harm, a government report will say on Tuesday. The report by the Government Accountability Office to Congress followed a series of mishaps in which dangerous pathogens were inadvertently released. The report, seen by Reuters, concluded that the Federal Select Agent Program needs an overhaul. The GAO audited laboratory safety oversight following errors that could have exposed dozens of people to live anthrax bacteria and the deadly toxin ricin. Its report will guide questioning of officials before the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s oversight subcommittee on Thursday. The Federal Select Agent Program is jointly run by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to the report, a chief concern is that the program is too focused on physical security measures, such as preventing theft from labs, and needs to focus more on biosafety issues that could protect researchers and the wider public from errors. The GAO report also noted that many of the labs using high-risk pathogens for research belong to either CDC or the USDA, and recommended that Congress consider setting up a fully independent oversight body to remove potential conflicts of interest. “The Select Agent Program does not fully meet our key elements of effective oversight,” the report stated. Safety lapses in CDC labs captured headlines in 2014 when scientists at a high-level biosecurity lab did not properly inactivate anthrax bacteria before sending the material to labs with fewer safeguards. More than 80 scientists were exposed to potentially live anthrax, though no one fell ill.  In the months that followed, the Food and Drug Administration disclosed the discovery of decades-old vials of smallpox in a storage closet, while a U.S. Army lab erroneously shipped live anthrax to nearly 200 labs worldwide. To address concerns of conflict of interest, CDC and APHIS have made structural changes to increase the program’s independence, but according to the GAO report, the program has not undergone a comprehensive risk management review, even as problems with lab safety continue to come to light. As recently as last November, the Department of Homeland Security found a private lab inadvertently shipped ricin - a lethal poison - to one of its training centers on multiple occasions in 2011. “Considering the type of research we’re talking about, we should have a much more robust, systematic oversight approach. That seems to be lacking,” said an aide to the House committee who declined to be identified. To avoid conflicts of interest, inspections of APHIS laboratories are supposed to be carried out by the CDC, and inspections of CDC labs are to be carried out by APHIS. But the report revealed that at least three times in 2015, APHIS inspected its own laboratories, partly because there is no process in place to ensure compliance. The report also cited excessive workloads for inspectors, which delay inspection reports and make it harder to retain personnel. In some cases, inspectors have been assigned to tasks outside of their expertise. For example, the GAO found that an APHIS physical security expert was asked to inspect ventilation systems - a critical protection against the accidental release of dangerous pathogens.  Short of a move by Congress to create an independent oversight agency, GAO recommended that CDC and APHIS officials conduct a risk assessment of the Select Agent Program and how it handles conflicts of interest. It also recommended that program officials shift inspection priorities to focus on high-risk activities in labs and develop a joint plan to train and hire inspectors.  The Health and Human Services Department, which oversees CDC, and the USDA, which runs APHIS, agreed with many of these recommendations, according to the report. Officials from the CDC and APHIS will testify at the Thursday hearing.  ",Exclusive: U.S. needs to improve oversight of labs handling dangerous pathogens - report
0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s top national security aides pushed back on Monday against U.S. lawmakers calling for a new congressional war authorization, saying it would be a mistake to impose geographic or time limits on the campaign against Islamic State and other militant groups. “War is fundamentally unpredictable,” Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis told a Senate hearing about a potential new authorization for the use of military force, or AUMF, Congress’ most significant step in years toward taking back control of its constitutional right to authorize war. Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson both told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee it would put U.S. forces at risk if existing authorizations were repealed without new ones in place. They said they do not need a new AUMF to justify ongoing military action. “The 2001 AUMF provides statutory authority for ongoing U.S. military operations against al-Qaeda; the Taliban; and associated forces, including against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS,” Tillerson said. Republican and Democratic members of Congress have argued for years that Congress ceded too much authority over the military to the White House after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But divisions over how much control they should exert over the Pentagon have stymied repeated efforts to pass a new AUMF. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who proposed an authorization with Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, said Congress should “buy in” to military conflicts by exerting its constitutional authority to declare war. “Here in the Senate, we aspire to be more than just a cog in a feedback loop,” Flake said. He argued that passing an AUMF would send an important message that Washington is unified to U.S. troops, allies and adversaries. “We have a job to do,” Kaine said, questioning whether resistance to a new AUMF was simply opposition to congressional oversight. Concerns intensified this month after four U.S. soldiers were killed in Niger, and previously over Trump’s talk about the possibility of an attack on North Korea and an April attack on an airfield in Syria. Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committee’s chairman, said the ambush in Niger shows U.S. forces “can find themselves in combat at any moment.” Congress has not passed an AUMF since the 2002 measure authorizing the Iraq War. But the legal justification for most military action for the past 16 years is the older authorization passed days after the Sept. 11 attacks, for the campaign against al Qaeda and affiliates. Backers of a new AUMF say the 2001 authorization has let presidents wage war wherever they like, without answering to Congress, or the public. For example, Islamic State did not exist in 2001. “I do not think the American people want the United States conducting a global, endless ‘Shadow War,’ under-the-radar, covert and beyond  scrutiny,” said Senator Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on the foreign relations panel. Mattis said he was not averse to a new authorization. But he said imposing limits would help the non-state actors who are America’s adversaries in a “non-traditional” war spanning much of the globe.  “If the enemy hopes we are going to quit on a certain day, or if they know we won’t deal with them if they step over a certain border, then the enemy is going to do exactly that,” Mattis said. Trump’s fellow Republicans control majorities in both the Senate and House of Representatives but there are deep divisions over any possible new authorization within the party, as well as between Republicans and Democrats. While some Republicans echo Flake in calling for Congress to weigh in, more hawkish lawmakers say military commanders should decide how to fight America’s enemies. Some Democrats say they want an AUMF limiting why, where and for how long U.S. forces can be sent to fight, but others refuse to go on the record supporting any conflict.

Podesta stepped down on the same day federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election campaign charged former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort and a business associate, Rick Gates, with money laundering. Manafort, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates pleaded not guilty to a 12-count indictment with charges ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The indictment against Manafort and Gates listed two unnamed  firms as “Company A” and “Company B” that lobbied several lawmakers on behalf of Ukraine at Manafort’s request. The indictment did not name Podesta Group. A spokesperson for the Podesta Group said after Podesta stepped down on Monday that it had been in contact with investigators on special counsel Robert Mueller’s team and was fully cooperating with the probe. The spokesperson also said the Podesta Group fully complied with the law in disclosing its lobbying on behalf of the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, a group linked to Manafort and named in the indictment. Podesta Group filed lobbying disclosures with the Department of Justice in April and August saying it did work in 2012 for the same pro-Russian Ukrainian group for which Manafort had worked. Podesta Group work alongside another Washington lobbying firm, Mercury LLC, which also said on Monday that it was cooperating with Mueller’s team. No charges were filed against anyone with Podesta Group or Mercury.  Tony Podesta did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. Podesta was the head of the firm that bore his name. It did  $10.7 million in lobbying in the first nine months of 2017, according to disclosures the firm filed with the U.S. Congress. He is the brother of John Podesta, who served as chairman of the presidential campaign of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton, and as a senior White House adviser to Democratic former President Barack Obama. Mueller’s team has been investigating alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign, but neither Trump nor the campaign were mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates.  While Podesta Group is seen as a mainly Democratic lobbying firm, Mercury is viewed as mainly a Republican shop. Mercury is a subsidiary of Omnicom Group and does public relations work in addition to lobbying. Omnicom did not reply to a request for comment. Podesta is listed as a lobbyist on several of the firm’s largest accounts including Wells Fargo, Lockheed Martin, Oracle, Wal-Mart, Textron and General Dynamics.

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An obscure Trump campaign adviser pleaded guilty to lying to FBI agents about contacts with people who claimed to have ties to top Russian officials, in the first criminal charges alleging links between the campaign and Moscow, said court documents released on Monday. George Papadopoulos, who joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016, lied in January about communicating with those individuals to arrange a meeting between then-Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, Special Counsel Robert Mueller said in the documents. The documents said an unidentified campaign official advised Papadopoulos around May 2016 that Trump himself “is not doing these trips” but that “it should be someone low-level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.” While not mentioned in the documents, top Trump campaign advisers, including Trump’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr.; his son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Campaign Manager Paul Manafort met at Trump Tower in New York in June 2016 with Russians claiming to have derogatory information on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. It was not known whether that meeting resulted from Papadopoulos’ efforts. The special counsel said Papadopoulos - a Chicago-based international energy lawyer - lied to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents about when he learned from an unnamed foreign professor that Russia claimed to have “dirt” in the form of “thousands of emails” on Clinton. Prosecutors said Papadopoulos told agents he had been in contact with the professor before he joined Trump’s campaign. In fact, they said, Papadopoulos met with the professor after joining the campaign. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Monday played down Papadopoulos’ campaign role, saying it was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer. “He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she told a news briefing. “Any actions that he took would have been on his own.” Papadopoulos’ lawyers said in a statement it was “in the best interest of our client .... that we refrain from commenting on George’s case.”  The documents were released just after indictments charging Manafort and business associate Rick Gates with multiple offenses, including money laundering, conspiracy against the United States and failing to register as foreign agents. None of the charges against Manafort and Gates, however, directly relate to Mueller’s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and what U.S. intelligence agencies concluded was a Russian bid to boost Trump’s candidacy. The prosecutors said Papadopoulos had been emailing with a “Campaign Supervisor,” “Senior Policy Adviser” and a “High-Ranking Campaign Official.” An official familiar with congressional investigations into alleged contacts between the campaign and Russia said the Senate Intelligence Committee already had copies of an extensive file of Trump campaign emails that included emails between Papadopoulos and the campaign. One email shows Manafort had been discussing Papadopoulos’ efforts to arrange a Trump visit to Russia with at least one other campaign official. Papadopoulos pleaded guilty on Oct. 5, according to a court statement by Mueller’s office. As part of a plea deal, Papadopoulos agreed to plead guilty to making a “materially false, fictitious and fraudulent statement” to FBI agents. “Through his false statements and omissions, defendant Papadopoulos impeded the FBI’s ongoing investigation into the existence of any links or coordination between individuals associated with the Campaign and the Russian government’s efforts to interfere with the 2016 presidential election,” a court document said. The FBI arrested Papadopoulos on July 27 after he arrived at Dulles International Airport near Washington. In an Oct. 5 letter to the Chicago man’s lawyer, Mueller and his team noted that Papadopoulos faced up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $9,500. But they agreed “to bring to the court’s attention at sentencing the defendant’s efforts to cooperate with the government” on condition that he continued providing information on to prosecutors, the document said. Court documents said Papadopoulos lied to the FBI shortly after Trump’s Jan. 20 inauguration, when the law enforcement agency had an open investigation into the alleged Russian government efforts to interfere in the 2016 campaign. In addition to lying about the timing of his contacts with the professor, prosecutors said Papadopoulos mischaracterized his contacts with that individual as “inconsequential.” “In truth and in fact, however, defendant Papadopoulos understood the professor to have substantial connections to high-level Russian government officials and that the professor spoke with some of those officials in Moscow” before telling Papadopoulos about the “dirt” on Clinton, said the prosecutors. The prosecutors said Papadopoulos also lied to the FBI in saying that a meeting the professor arranged for him in London with an unidentified Russian woman with ties to senior Russian officials occurred before the Chicago man joined the campaign. The meeting took place on or about March 24, 2016, and the Russian woman was introduced to Papadopoulos as a relative of Putin, although it turned out that she was not related to the Russian leader, according to the documents. Papadopoulos then worked with the professor and the Russian woman to set up the Putin meeting, and kept other Trump foreign policy advisers appraised of his contacts, they said. In one email, the documents said, the Russian woman told Papadopoulos that “The Russian Federation would love to welcome him (Trump) once his candidature would be officially announced.” The prosecutors said that on or about March 31 Papadopoulos attended a “national security meeting” in Washington with then-candidate Trump and other campaign foreign policy advisers. When he introduced himself to the group, the prosecutors said, “he stated, in sum and substance, that he had connections that could help arrange a meeting between then candidate Trump and President Putin.” In mid-April, the professor introduced Papadopoulos via an email to an individual in Moscow who the documents dubbed the Russian MFA Connection - MFA being the initials for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The pair had multiple conversations over the proceeding weeks about setting the “groundwork” for a Trump-Putin meeting. ",Former Trump adviser Papadopoulos pleads guilty to lying to FBI

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A top U.S. regulator for Wall Street took the unusual step on Monday of directly asking President Donald Trump to veto a resolution that allows financial companies to block customers from banding together to sue, a request likely to be ignored. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent regulator headed by Democrat Richard Cordray, finalized a rule in July barring banks, credit-card issuers and other financial companies from requiring customers to give up their rights to join group lawsuits, known as class actions, and only take potential disputes to closed-door arbitration. Congress recently voted to kill the rule in a special resolution that Trump, a Republican, is expected to sign into law soon. “You alone now have the power to safeguard people’s ability to take action together and go to court when they are wronged,” Cordray, expected to resign soon to run for Ohio governor, wrote to Trump. White House officials were not immediately available to comment on the letter. In class actions, individuals with the same complaint band together to lower lawsuit costs. Trump has not vetoed any legislation since taking office in January. But he has frequently criticized both Cordray, appointed by former Democratic President Barack Obama, and the CFPB, established after the financial crisis to protect individuals against predatory lending. Cordray wrote he had never met or spoken to Trump, but that “many have told me.... your mind is made up” about the resolution. Shortly after the Senate passed the resolution last Tuesday, the White House released a statement saying the CFPB rule would give consumers fewer options to resolve disputes quickly and efficiently and would primarily enrich trial lawyers. The administration has also said the CFPB used faulty research to write the rule. The CFPB says its five-year study into mandatory arbitration was thorough and its rule based on sound data. Rule supporters say arbitration is stacked in favor of companies, which hire the mediators, and that the right to trial is enshrined in the Constitution. On Friday, military veterans also asked for a veto. Regulators almost never make personal pleas for vetoes, let alone release their requests publicly.  Cordray has a strained relationship with Republicans, who say he has too much power because he both writes and enforces rules and can only be fired “for cause,” a strict standard nearly impossible to meet. Trump has gone as far as arguing in court filings that the CFPB is unconstitutional and he should have the power to fire its director.  ",U.S. regulator asks Trump not to dismantle class-action rule

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The defense in Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez’s federal corruption trial rested on Monday, court records showed, as a case that could have political repercussions in Washington nears an end after eight weeks of testimony. As expected, Menendez and his co-defendant, Florida ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, declined to take the witness stand in their defense. Closing arguments were set to begin no earlier than Wednesday morning. Menendez, 63, is accused of accepting bribes from Melgen, including luxury vacations, private flights and campaign contributions, in exchange for using his political influence to help Melgen in a variety of ways. Lawyers for Menendez and Melgen have told the jury in Newark, New Jersey, that they did nothing wrong and that their actions stemmed from a close, brother-like relationship. The case could have an outsized effect on Capitol Hill, where Republicans hold a narrow 52-48 edge in the Senate. If Menendez is convicted and either resigns or is expelled before Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie’s term expires in January, the governor would presumably name a Republican to replace him. The Democratic candidate to succeed Christie, Phil Murphy, holds a comfortable lead in polls ahead of the state’s gubernatorial election on Nov. 7. A Republican effort to repeal former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law failed by a single vote in the Senate in July, and the party’s pursuit of tax reform is expected to be similarly hard-fought. Defense attorneys ended their case on Monday soon after the judge overseeing the trial, William Walls, denied their request to declare a mistrial. The lawyers had argued that Walls unfairly limited the witnesses and evidence they could present to jurors. Menendez intervened with Medicare officials on Melgen’s behalf after the agency determined the doctor had overbilled it by millions of dollars, according to prosecutors. Melgen was convicted separately earlier this year in Florida of Medicare fraud, though the New Jersey jury has not heard about that case. In addition, the senator pressed U.S. officials to resolve a port dispute in the Dominican Republic involving one of Melgen’s business ventures and to issue visas for several of Melgen’s foreign girlfriends, prosecutors say. Among the witnesses who appeared for the defense were two of Menendez’s colleagues: Republican U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham and Democratic U.S. Senator Cory Booker, who is New Jersey’s other senator. Both men testified about Menendez’s good character without reference to the current charges. ",Defense rests in Democratic Senator Menendez's bribery trial
0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, a businessman and longtime Republican Party operative, surrendered on Monday to the Federal Bureau of Investigation to face the first charges produced by a special counsel investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Manafort and his associate Rick Gates were indicted by a federal grand jury. The 12-count indictment included conspiracy against the United States, conspiracy to launder money, being an unregistered agent of a foreign principal, making false and misleading statements and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign banks and financial accounts. Both pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Kremlin has denied it meddled in the election campaign to try to tilt the vote in Trump’s favor. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign. Who is Paul Manafort? Manafort is a veteran Republican operative who has worked as a Washington lobbyist and international political consultant. His former clients include authoritarian leaders such as the late Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines and Russian and Ukrainian businessmen and politicians. Manafort was a campaign manager for the Trump campaign in the summer of 2016.     What does the indictment charge they did? The indictment against Manafort and Gates says they both generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from U.S. authorities between 2006 and through at least 2016.  In June, Manafort and Gates retroactively registered with the Justice Department as foreign agents, in a Foreign Agents Registration Act filing that showed they earned $17.1 million for lobbying on behalf of the Party of Regions, a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine, between 2012 and 2014. The indictment said they concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties. They used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, prosecutors said. The indictment says that more than $75 million flowed through Manafort’s and Gates’ offshore accounts. Manafort, the indictment said, laundered more than $18 million. The indictment also alleges Manafort and Gates, along with others, conspired to defraud the United States by “impeding, impairing, obstructing, and defeating the lawful governmental functions” of the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department between 2006 and 2017. Manafort was indicted on nine counts and Gates was indicted on eight counts. What are Manafort’s links to Trump?  Manafort joined the Trump presidential campaign in March 2016 and later became campaign manager, but he was forced to resign in August as questions emerged about his previous work for the political party of the Kremlin-backed former Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovich.  Business Insider reported that Manafort and Trump have been connected since the 1980s, when Trump hired Manafort’s lobbying firm to help the Trump Organization.  In 2006, Manafort and his wife bought an apartment in Trump Tower in New York, which Manafort still owns and where he lives when he is in Manhattan, Business Insider reported. How do the charges relate to Trump? “It has nothing to do with the campaign or the allegations of collusion with Russia,” said Washington attorney John Dowd, who represents Trump in the Russia probe. A Trump confidante said: “As it relates to the president, this is nothing. All of the 12 counts of the indictment that came down today, all of it predates their tenure at the campaign.” The special counsel’s indictment says Manafort and Gates laundered the money through “scores of United States and foreign corporations, partnerships and bank accounts” from approximately 2006 through “at least 2016.” Who is Rick Gates? Rick Gates was Manafort’s deputy and business associate. According to two former high-level Trump staffers, Gates essentially functioned as the Trump campaign manager for more than two months, all while not collecting a paycheck. The New York Times reported in June that the Trump transition team had been ordered to preserve materials related to ongoing investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. According to the Times, the memo from the special counsel’s office to the former transition team also sought specific information on five people including Manafort and Gates. According to the indictment, between at least 2006 and 2015 Manafort and Gates acted as unregistered agents of the Ukrainian government, a Ukrainian political party that was headed by Ukraine’s then president, Yanukovich, and Yanukovich himself. The indictment said they both generated tens of millions of dollars in income as a result of their Ukraine work.  Yanukovich has been living in exile in Russia since he was ousted by mass street protests in Kiev in 2014. His departure lit the fuse for Moscow’s annexation of Crimea and a separatist uprising in mainly Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine. The indictment said Gates aided Manafort in obtaining money from offshore accounts and that Gates used that money to pay for personal expenses including “his mortgage, children’s tuition, and interior decorating of his Virginia residence.”  How significant is Gates’ arrest? The indictment lays out the extent of Gates’ involvement with Manafort going back years. That could potentially open the door for Gates to testify against Manafort and others in the future. David Sklansky, a professor  at Stanford Law School and former federal prosecutor, said Gates could feel pressure to cooperate and provide testimony against Trump.

An independent senator from Vermont who espouses democratic socialism, Sanders lost the Democratic Party’s 2016 presidential nomination to Hillary Clinton but remains an influential voice on the party’s left wing and repeatedly tops opinion polls of the country’s most well-liked politicians. De Blasio wants a state tax hike on people making more than $500,000 a year, saying it would generate hundreds of millions of dollars for repairs and upgrades to the century-old subway system. His plan, to increase the tax rate on an individual’s income above $500,000 to 4.41 percent from 3.876 percent, would also fund half-price bus and subway rides for up to 800,000 of the city’s poorest residents. But New York state, not the city, runs the subway through the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Governor Andrew Cuomo, a fellow Democrat, has dismissed de Blasio’s plan, saying a tax hike would not get through the Republican-controlled New York Senate. Cuomo has proposed charging drivers a toll to enter parts of Manhattan, but de Blasio has said that would put the burden on the city’s poorer outer boroughs.  Sanders, a New York City native, was due to join de Blasio later on Monday at a campaign rally ahead of next week’s mayoral election. Polls show de Blasio comfortably winning a second term against Republican challenger Nicole Malliotakis and independent candidate Bo Dietl.

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is likely to pick Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the next head of the U.S. central bank, a source familiar with the matter said on Monday, prompting investors to push down yields on Treasury notes.    The Republican president, who is considering Powell, current Fed Chair Janet Yellen and three others for the top central bank job, will announce his decision on Thursday, a White House official said separately. By picking Powell, a soft-spoken centrist and Fed governor since 2012, Trump would get the combination of a leadership change and the continuity offered by somebody who has been a part of the Yellen-run Fed that has kept the economy and markets steady in recent years. Powell, 64, has supported Yellen’s general direction in setting monetary policy, and in recent years has shared her concerns that weak inflation justified a continued cautious approach to raising interest rates. “Powell has not offended people, and that’s a huge advantage in Washington. He’s the kind of guy who can get through Senate confirmation, and this administration has so many other problems to deal with,” said John Silva, chief economist at Wells Fargo. The main challenger to Powell is Stanford University economist John Taylor, a favorite of conservative Republicans who believe monetary policy has been too loose under Yellen and want the central bank to rely more on rules when setting rates. Taylor has spent the last two decades refining and pushing for wider use of a rule that sets out where rates should be, given certain conditions of inflation and the broader economy. His rule implies they should be higher than they are now. Critics say that a Taylor-run Fed would run the risk of tightening monetary policy too fast and choking off the recovery from the 2007-2009 financial crisis and recession.  The race for the Fed job has shifted between Yellen, who was nominated by former President Barack Obama to a one-year term in 2014, Powell and Taylor in recent weeks. Financial markets had pushed Treasury yields higher on talk Taylor would get the job. Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes US10YT=RR were yielding 2.37 percent in mid-afternoon trading on Monday, down from 2.43 percent on Friday.

0,True,"October 19, 2017 ",politicsNews,"(Reuters) - Former President Barack Obama, back on the campaign trail on Thursday for the first time since he left the White House, called on voters to reject a growing “politics of division” that he said was corroding American democracy. Without mentioning Republican President Donald Trump by name, Obama told campaign rallies in New Jersey and Virginia that voters could send a powerful message about the type of politics they want by backing Democrats in Nov. 7 elections in the two states. “What we can’t have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before, that dates back centuries,” Obama told a cheering crowd in Newark, New Jersey, that chanted: “Four more years.” “Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That’s folks looking 50 years back,” Obama said. “It’s the 21st century, not the 19th century.” At a later stop in Richmond, Virginia, Obama said modern politics increasingly did not reflect basic American values of inclusiveness and were driving people away from the process. “We’ve got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry, to demonize people who have different ideas, to get the base all riled up because it provides a short-term tactical advantage. Sometimes that feels frustrating,” Obama said. Many of Obama’s comments appeared to be thinly veiled swipes at Trump, whose combative style and inflammatory rhetoric have led to frequent controversy and stoked political tensions. Obama made the remarks just hours after former President George W. Bush, a Republican, also took an indirect swing at Trump with a speech decrying “bullying and prejudice” while defending immigrants and trade.  Obama’s appearances were aimed at driving up Democratic turnout in New Jersey and Virginia, the only two states holding elections for governor this year. Democrats hope Obama can bring some of the young, minority and infrequent voters who powered his two elections to the White House out to the polls in off-year elections. The two contests will be closely watched to see if Democrats can convert the grassroots resistance to Trump into electoral wins after falling short earlier this year in four competitive special congressional elections. The governor’s races, and a special election in December for a U.S. Senate seat in Alabama, could offer clues to the national political mood ahead of next year’s congressional elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 33 of the Senate’s 100 seats will be up for grabs. Republicans currently control both chambers. Since leaving the White House in January, Obama has frequently been forced to defend his record as Trump and Republicans have tried to gut his signature healthcare law and roll back his immigration and environmental policies. While he has rarely spoken out about politics in the past nine months, Obama said it was critical that supporters get their friends and families to vote. In Newark, he said no one should assume victory just because opinion polls show Phil Murphy, a former investment banker and U.S. ambassador to Germany, has a comfortable lead on Republican opponent Kim Guadagno, the state’s lieutenant governor. “I don’t know if you all noticed that, but you can’t take any election for granted,” he said in a reference to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s surprise loss last year in the presidential race. In the political battleground of Virginia, polls show a close contest between Democrat Ralph Northam, the state’s lieutenant governor, and Republican Ed Gillespie, a former Republican National Committee chairman who has been endorsed by Trump. Obama carried Virginia in both 2008 and 2012, and Democrat Hillary Clinton won the state over Trump by 5 percentage points in 2016. ",Obama blasts 'politics of division' on return to campaign trail

0,True,"October 30, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators probing Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election charged President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and another aide, Rick Gates, with money laundering on Monday.  A third former Trump adviser, George Papadopoulos, pleaded guilty in early October to lying to the FBI, it was announced on Monday. It was a sharp escalation of U.S. Justice Department Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s five-month-old investigation into alleged Russian efforts to tilt the election in Trump’s favour and into potential collusion by Trump aides. Manafort, 68, a longtime Republican operative, and Gates were arraigned at a federal courthouse in Washington.  Both men pleaded not guilty to the charges in a 12-count indictment, ranging from money laundering to acting as unregistered agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government. The judge ordered house arrest for both men, and set a $10 million (7.57 million pounds) unsecured bond for Manafort and a $5 million unsecured bond for Gates. With unsecured bonds, they are released without having to pay but will owe money if they fail to appear in court. There will be another hearing on Thursday. The developments in the Mueller probe weighed on the U.S. dollar, which slipped 0.5 percent against a basket of currencies. Mueller’s investigation and others by congressional committees into alleged Russian efforts to influence the election have cast a shadow over Trump’s first nine months in office. U.S. intelligence agencies say Russia interfered in the election by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Russia denies the allegations and Trump denies any collusion. Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort and Gates. The charges, some going back more than a decade, centre on Manafort’s work for Ukraine. The indictment includes accusations of conspiracy against the United States, failure to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government and conspiracy to launder money, a count that carries a 20-year maximum prison sentence.     A White House spokeswoman said the indictment had nothing to do with Trump or his campaign and showed no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russia.  “We’ve been saying from Day One there’s no evidence of Trump-Russia collusion, and nothing in the indictment today changes that at all,” spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told a news briefing. Manafort’s attorney, Kevin Downing said in a statement that there was no evidence the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government. Downing said Manafort’s work for the Ukrainians ended in 2014, two years before he joined the Trump campaign. Downing accused Mueller of using a “novel” legal theory to prosecute Manafort under a law requiring lobbyists to register with the Department of Justice when they are doing work for a foreign government. In a development directly related to Trump’s 2016 election campaign, it emerged on Monday that Papadopoulos, a former campaign adviser, pleaded guilty earlier this month to making false statements to Federal Bureau of Investigation agents.         Mueller’s office said Papadopoulos lied to FBI agents about the timing of contact between him and a professor in London who claimed to have information that would hurt Clinton.     Papadopoulos, a little-known former foreign policy adviser in the campaign, made a plea bargain that stated he had since “met with the Government on numerous occasions to provide information and answer questions,” according to a court document. Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said Papadopoulos’ role in the campaign was “extremely limited” and that he was a volunteer. “He asked to do things (and) he was basically pushed back or not responded to in any way,” she said. In a May 4 email quoted in the Papadopoulos indictment, a Trump campaign employee forwarded a message from Papadopoulos proposing a meeting between Trump and the Russian government to another campaign official. The employee included a note, according to the indictment, that read: “Let’s discuss. We need someone to communicate that DT is not doing these trips. It should be someone low level in the campaign so as not to send any signal.” A source in Washington, who did not want to be identified and who has seen the email, said the sender was Manafort and the recipient was Gates. Manafort ran the Trump campaign from June to August of 2016 before resigning amid reports he might have received millions of dollars in illegal payments from a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.     Trump reiterated his frustration on Monday with the Mueller probe, which he has called “a witch hunt.” “Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren’t Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????,” Trump wrote on Twitter, referring to Clinton. Mueller has been investigating Manafort’s financial and real estate dealings and his prior work for a political group, the Party of Regions, which backed former pro-Kremlin Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovich. Both Manafort and Gates generated tens of millions of dollars of income from Ukraine work and laundered money through scores of U.S. and foreign entities to hide payments from American authorities, the indictment said.  They concealed from the United States their work and revenue as agents of Ukrainian political parties and used their wealth to lead a “lavish lifestyle” without paying taxes on the income, it said. The indictment said Manafort owned properties in Manhattan,  Brooklyn, the Hamptons, Arlington, Virginia, and elsewhere. Prosecutors said Manafort spent almost $1 million on eight rugs in two years and more than $1.3 million on clothes from shops in Beverly Hills, California, and New York City. They also said he had been making payments on four Range Rovers and a Mercedes-Benz. Gates was a longtime business partner of Manafort and has ties to Russian and Ukrainian oligarchs. He also served as deputy to Manafort during his brief tenure as Trump’s campaign chairman. ","Two ex-Trump aides charged in Russia probe, third pleads guilty"
0,True,"October 29, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The investigation into possible Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election will enter a new phase as early as Monday, when the first charges resulting from the probe could be unsealed and a target taken into custody. A federal grand jury approved the indictment on Friday and a federal judge ordered it sealed, a source briefed on the matter has told Reuters, adding it could be unsealed as soon as Monday. The indictment could mark a dramatic turn in special counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 race and any possible links with officials from President Donald Trump’s campaign. The Russia investigation has cast a shadow over Trump’s 9-month-old presidency and widened the partisan rift between Republicans and Democrats. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Democrat Hillary Clinton by hacking and releasing embarrassing emails and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her. Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, has been looking into possible links between Trump aides and foreign governments, as well as potential money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes, according to sources familiar with the probe. He also is exploring whether Trump or his aides have tried to obstruct the investigation. Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after Trump’s May 9 firing of FBI Director James Comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with Russia. Trump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate. In a later interview with NBC, he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason. Trump has denied the allegations of collusion with the Russians and called the probe “a witch hunt.” The Kremlin also has denied the allegations. On Sunday, Trump tried to shift the focus back to Democrats and Clinton, tweeting that the Russia issue was being used to sidetrack the Republican push for tax reform and praising Republican “anger and unity” on the need to look into whether Democrats and the Clinton campaign paid for a portion of a dossier that detailed accusations about Trump’s ties to Russia. Special White House counsel Ty Cobb said the president’s tweets “are unrelated to the activities of the Special Counsel, with whom he continues to cooperate.” Investigators led by Mueller have interviewed former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former spokesman Sean Spicer and other current and former White House and campaign officials. In July, FBI agents raided the Virginia home of Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine are being investigated by Mueller’s team. Mueller also has investigated Michael Flynn, an adviser to Trump’s campaign and later his national security adviser. Flynn was fired from that post in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year. The indictment in Mueller’s probe was first reported by CNN, which said the target could be taken into custody on Monday. That possibility spurred some of Trump’s conservative allies to call for Mueller’s firing. Sebastian Gorka, an outspoken former adviser who left the White House in August, said on Twitter that Mueller “should be stripped of his authority” and investigated if he executed warrants in the probe. The White House said in the summer that Trump had no intention of firing Mueller even though he questioned his impartiality. Republicans also criticized leaks to the press about the indictment and raised the possibility that those responsible could be prosecuted. But Republican Senator Rob Portman said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump had been “too defensive” about the Russia probe. He said there should be broad outrage about Russia’s attempted meddling.

0,True,"October 29, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s plan for overhauling the U.S. tax system faced growing opposition from interest groups on Sunday, as Republicans prepare to unveil sweeping legislation that could eliminate some of the most popular tax breaks to help pay for lower taxes. Republicans who control the U.S. House of Representatives will not reveal their bill until Wednesday. But the National Association of Home Builders, a powerful housing industry trade group, is already vowing to defeat it over a change that could affect the use of home mortgage deductions, while Republican leaders try to head off opposition to possible changes to individual retirement savings and state and local tax payments. Trump and Republicans have vowed to enact tax reform this year for the first time since 1986. But the plan to deliver up to $6 trillion in tax cuts for businesses and individuals faces challenges even from rank-and-file House Republicans. House and Senate Republicans are on a fast-track to pass separate tax bills before the Nov. 23 U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, iron out differences in December, send a final version to Trump’s desk before January and ultimately hand the president  his first major legislative victory. Analysts say there is a good chance the tax overhaul will be delayed until next year. The NAHB, which boasts 130,000 member firms employing 9 million workers, says the bill would harm U.S. home prices by marginalizing the value of mortgage interest deductions as an incentive for buying homes. The trade group wants legislation to offer a tax credit equaling 12 percent of mortgage interest and property tax payments but says it was rebuffed by House Republican leaders. “We’re opposed to the tax bill without the tax credit in there, and we’ll be working very aggressively to see it defeated,” NAHB chief executive Jerry Howard told Reuters.  House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady, the top House Republican on tax policy, suggested in a statement that the NAHB credit could still be included, saying: “I hope members of Congress will examine it closely to determine if they want it included.” Republicans warned that the Trump tax plan is entering a new and difficult phase as lobbyists ramp up pressure on lawmakers to spare their pet tax breaks.  “When groups start rallying against things and they succeed, everything starts unraveling,” Senator Bob Corker, a leading Republican fiscal hawk, told CBS’ Face the Nation. ANXIETY IN HIGH-TAX STATES One of the biggest challenges involves a proposal to eliminate the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), which analysts say would hit upper middle-class families in high income tax states such as New York, New Jersey and California. The states are home to enough House Republicans to stymie legislation.  Brady gave ground over the weekend, saying he would allow a deduction for some local taxes to remain. “We are restoring an itemized property tax deduction to help taxpayers with local tax burdens,” Brady said in another statement.    But the gesture appeared to do little to turn the tide of opposition to SALT’s elimination.  “I’m not going to sign onto anything until the full package is fully analyzed by economists,” Representative Peter King of New York told the Fox News program Sunday Morning Futures.  “The fact that we’re getting it at the eleventh hour raises real issues with me,” he added. A lobby coalition representing state and local governments, realtors and public unions rejected Brady’s statement outright, saying the move would “unfairly penalize taxpayers in states that rely significantly on income taxes.” House Republicans have also faced opposition from Trump and others after proposing to sharply curtail tax-free contributions to 401(k) programs and move retirement savings to a style of account that allows tax-free withdrawals, rather than the tax-exempt contributions that are popular with 401(k) investors. House Republicans now say they could permit higher 401(k) contribution limits but continue to talk about tax-free withdrawals. “We will expand the amount that you can invest. But we’ll also give you an option to actually not be taxed later in life,” House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told Fox News. The current cap on annual 401(k) tax-free contributions is $18,000.  Corker said congressional tax committees seem to be falling short of their goal to eliminate $4 trillion in tax breaks to prevent the Trump plan from adding to the federal deficit.  “They’re having great difficulty just getting to $3.6 trillion,” said the Tennessee Republican, who has vowed to vote against tax reform if it increases a federal debt load that stands at more than $20 trillion.  Ohio’s Republican governor, John Kasich, told Fox News Sunday that spending on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security should also be reviewed as part of the effort to pay for tax cuts. “It may be separate from the tax bill, but it needs to happen,” Kasich said.

0,True,"October 28, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal grand jury on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge so it was not clear what the charges were or who the target was,  the source said, adding that it could be unsealed as early as Monday. The filing of charges by the grand jury in Washington was first reported on Friday by CNN, which said the target could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is investigating whether Trump campaign officials colluded with those Russian efforts. “If the Special Counsel finds it necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a May 17 letter appointing Mueller. Sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said he has used that broad authority to investigate links between Trump aides and foreign governments as well as possible money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Friday. Trump, a Republican who was elected president last November, has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Mueller’s investigation also includes an effort to determine whether Trump or any of his aides tried to obstruct justice.  The special counsel’s team has conducted interviews with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former spokesman Sean Spicer and other current and former White House officials. In July, FBI agents raided the home in Virginia of Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine are being investigated by Mueller’s team. Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with Russia. Trump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate and hurt morale, but in a later interview with NBC he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason.  The Russia investigation has cast a shadow over Trump’s nine-month-old presidency and widened the partisan rift between Republicans and Democrats. Republican lawmakers earlier this week launched investigations to examine several of Trump’s longstanding political grievances, including the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails and her alleged role in a sale of U.S. uranium to a Russian firm. Mueller’s team has also investigated Michael Flynn, who was an adviser to Trump’s campaign and later briefly served as his national security adviser. Flynn was fired from that post in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year. While he was on Trump’s campaign team, Flynn also had a $600,000 contract from a Turkish businessman to help discredit  U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s government of instigating a failed coup in July 2016. Former CIA director James Woolsey, who was also an adviser to the Trump campaign, has alleged that Flynn discussed with the businessman and two Turkish government ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States to face charges in Turkey. Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said on Friday that Woolsey and his wife have been in communication with the FBI and Mueller’s team about the claim. Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, “have responded to every request, whether from the FBI, or, more recently, the Office of the Special Counsel,” Franks said in a statement.  Flynn has previously denied through a spokesperson that such a plan was ever discussed.  Reuters reported on Thursday that Woolsey and his wife last year pitched a $10 million project to the same Turkish businessman who had agreed a smaller contract with Flynn. They did not win a contract. Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal but Flynn came under scrutiny because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did on the Gulen project.

The Washington Post reported last week that Marc Elias, a lawyer for 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Clinton, used campaign funds to hire Fusion GPS, the firm behind the dossier. Committees in both chambers of Congress have been investigating the origin and contents of the document. John Podesta, who was Clinton’s campaign chairman, and U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who was the head of the Democratic National Committee at the time, as well as Elias “absolutely need to be recalled” to testify,” Collins said in an appearance on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”  “It’s difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance,” Collins said. “But perhaps there’s something more going on here. But certainly, it’s worth additional questioning of those two witnesses. And the lawyer; absolutely, he more than anyone.”  It has been widely reported that supporters of Republican Jeb Bush, a primary opponent of Trump, initially paid for the firm’s research. Perkins Coie, Elias’ law firm, confirmed on Tuesday that it had hired Fusion GPS in April 2016. The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication backed by billionaire Republican megadonor Paul Singer, said on Friday it was the original funder of the Fusion GPS project to compile opposition research on multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Trump. Known as the Steele dossier because it was compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the document identified Russian businessmen and others who U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government. Representative Trey Gowdy, a Republican who runs the House Oversight Committee, said in an appearance on “Fox News Sunday” that he was more interested in whether the Federal Bureau of Investigation or the Department of Justice used the dossier in conducting their own probes.  “I don’t expect the (Democratic National Committee) to be objective,” Gowdy said. “Almost by definition, opposition research is not objective.  “The next thing that House Intel is trying to find out is whether or not the U.S. government relied on it.” ",Republican senator wants Democrats to testify on Trump dossier

The announcement came a day after a federal judge had given an unnamed bank more time to respond to the congressional panel’s subpoena to Fusion GPS, the research outfit that hired a former British spy to compile a dossier on presidential candidate Donald Trump.  The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative online publication backed by billionaire Republican mega-donor Paul Singer, said on Friday it was the original funder of the Fusion GPS project to compile opposition research on multiple Republican presidential candidates, including Trump. Trump and other Republicans have alleged that Russians paid Fusion GPS for research on their own dealings with the president and his campaign. But the Free Beacon said all the material it was provided came from public sources and that the effort was separate from a former British spy’s dossier of allegations of Russian financial and personal links to President Donald Trump’s campaign and associates. Known as the Steele dossier because it was compiled by former MI6 officer Christopher Steele, the document identified Russian businessmen and others whom U.S. intelligence analysts have concluded are Russian intelligence officers or working on behalf of the Russian government. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign and the Democratic National Committee began paying Fusion GPS in April 2016 for research on Trump, an arrangement that later produced the Steele dossier. Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has repeatedly called the dossier fake news. Much of the inflammatory and at times salacious content of the dossier has not been verified. However, U.S. officials have confirmed certain details. In a closed-door hearing with Senate Judiciary Committee investigators, Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson said there was no connection between the firm’s work on the dossier and its legal research on a lawsuit involving Russians who attended a June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., his son-in-law and close aide, Jared Kushner, and former campaign chief Paul Manafort, sources familiar with the hearing said.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican-led Federal Communications Commission is moving  to quickly undo roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing an onslaught of deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai on Wednesday disclosed his plans to ask the media and communications regulator on Nov. 16 to eliminate the 42-year-old ban on cross-ownership of a newspaper and TV station in a major market.  The changes would also make it easier for media companies to buy additional TV stations in the same market, or for local stations to jointly sell advertising time. The move, along with other expected FCC media rule changes, could usher in a new era of media consolidation that could help struggling newspapers and TV stations, but limit the diversity of media voices. FCC’s Pai has cited rising competition for advertising from websites like Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook Inc as a reason for easing the media ownership rules as well as helping struggling newspapers. Big media firms including Tegna Inc and Nexstar Media Group Inc, have cited the potential rule change as motivating them to look for expansion opportunities. In the near future, the decision could also allow Sinclair Broadcast Group’s, which is seeking approval for its proposed $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co, to avoid some divestitures in order to get the deal approved. Eliminating “outdated regulations that unnecessarily hobble local broadcast stations will benefit consumers in communities across the country,” said the National Association of Broadcasters Friday. Advocacy group Free Press criticized Pai’s proposal, saying it “ignores how decades of runaway media consolidation have significantly harmed local news and independent voices.” Anne Bentley, a spokeswoman for Tegna, a TV broadcaster formerly known as Gannett before it spun off the newspapers in 2015, said the company “expects to be a strategic and disciplined consolidator at this pivotal time of positive regulatory change.” Nexstar Chief Executive Officer Perry Sook said in a statement Thursday the changes would allow local broadcasters to “make additional investments in localized programming content, our people, news resources and reporting capabilities.” Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics, told Reuters the rollback of the rules means “we will see more consolidation on the local level, where TV stations or TV groups will buy local newspapers.” CBS Corp Chief Executive Les Moonves said in February he believed Pai’s deregulatory plans “will be very beneficial to our business.” With rule changes, CBS “would strategically want to buy some more.” In April, the FCC voted to reverse a 2016 decision that limits the number of television stations some broadcasters could buy. Under rules adopted in 1985, stations with weaker over-the-air signals could be partially counted against a broadcaster’s ownership cap. But last year, the FCC under Democratic President Barack Obama said those rules were outdated after the 2009 conversion to digital broadcasting, which eliminated the differences in station signal strength. Pai said in late March that he also planned to take a new look at the current overall limit on companies owning stations serving no more than 39 percent of U.S. television households.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York and California’s Democratic governors said on Friday residents would face hefty tax increases and some would leave their states under a proposal in the Republican tax plan that would eliminate state and local tax (SALT) deductions on federal income tax. Andrew Cuomo of New York and Jerry Brown of California spoke in a joint conference call a day after the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure that advanced President Donald Trump’s tax plan. Republican leaders have sketched out an outline of the tax measures that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday. If the SALT deduction were eliminated the tax package would  disproportionately hit residents of states that have high income taxes, many of which are historically Democratic, the governors said.  “This is an attack on California, New York and New Jersey, and other states that would not vote for Trump,” Brown said. “It’s a gross manipulation of our tax code.” The SALT deduction allows residents to subtract income taxes paid to states and local governments from the total income taxed by the federal government taxes. Its elimination would be one among a series of measures to offset lost revenues from what are envisaged as sweeping overall cuts on corporate and personal taxes. While analysts say the overall tax package would cut taxes for companies and individuals by up to $6 trillion over the next decade, many residents of high-tax states who use the deduction would pay more, the governors said.  In New York, taxpayers would pay an average of an additional $5,300 in federal income taxes a year without the SALT deduction, Cuomo’s office said in a separate statement. That sharp increase in taxes would likely lead to an exodus of residents, starting with high earners, who would see the greatest increases, Cuomo said. “Higher-income people will move,” he said. Some Republican lawmakers from high-tax states voted against the budget measure on Thursday to express opposition to the elimination of the SALT deduction. Republican congressional leaders are working to allay their concerns. “If the SALT is repealed, we would expect some deterioration of credit quality for affected states and localities in the medium term, including some price pressure on housing markets in areas bordering states with lower local taxes (eg, southern New Jersey),” Barclays analysts wrote to clients on Thursday. “However, municipal bonds issued by high tax states and localities would likely become even more valuable to investors, and there could be stronger demand from retail investors, bringing yields and muni-Treasury ratios down,” Barclays said.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The White House promoted President Donald Trump’s tax cut plan on Friday with a forecast of faster U.S. economic expansion and wage growth, as independent analysts said the plan would swell the budget deficit and provide little spark to the economy. The rival projections reflected the many unknowns swirling around the plan, expected to be unveiled in legislative form on Wednesday. Republicans were still undecided on some of the hardest parts, such as how to pay for the costly cuts proposed. Weeks and possibly months of debate lie ahead for a project that Trump promised to tackle in his 2016 election campaign. In September, he unveiled a rough framework for cutting taxes. Now he wants Congress to approve a bill, which would mark his first major legislative victory, before the end of the year. The Trump plan for tax cuts of the sort normally reserved for times of economic recession is taking shape in Congress amid signs the economy is already growing briskly. Gross domestic product increased at a 3 percent annual rate in the July-September period, supported by strong business spending on equipment, the Commerce Department said on Friday. The economic recovery begun under former President Barack Obama after the 2007-2009 recession is in its eighth year and showing little signs of fatigue amid a tightening labor market. “It’s hard to say that we need to have tax cuts at the individual level ... you don’t need to provide further fiscal stimulus when the economy is already strong,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group in Princeton, New Jersey. Faced with improving economic prospects, Republicans have shifted their rhetoric on tax cuts away from getting the economy moving again to keeping it on an expansion track. An analysis released by White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett said slashing the top federal corporate tax rate and letting businesses write off the full cost of most capital investments immediately, as proposed in the plan, would bring faster growth and higher wages. Hassett’s projections envisioned a 3 percent to 5 percent increase in GDP that, over 10 years, could represent an additional $700 billion to $1.2 trillion in economic output. But the Tax Policy Center, a nonprofit Washington think tank, released an analysis that concluded the Trump tax plan would not produce a significant, permanent economic boost. The group said the plan would reduce federal tax revenue by roughly $2.4 trillion over the next decade and by over $3 trillion in the decade after that, adding significantly to a U.S. national debt that already exceeds $20.4 trillion. The center said Trump’s tax cuts would drive new activity at first, but that the impact would be blunted in later years by rising deficits, forcing more federal borrowing to finance the tax cuts and driving up borrowing costs for the private sector. Hassett told reporters he does not expect tax reform to add significantly to the deficit. But he conceded that it would become “a big negative” if economic growth failed to materialize and the debt level soared. The framework of Trump’s plan unveiled last month called for reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, the small business rate to 25 percent from up to 39.6 percent and the top individual rate to 35 percent from 39.6 percent. It also called specifically for repealing the estate tax on inheritances and the alternative minimum tax, both of which are typically paid by the country’s highest-income earners. Less clear were the plan’s proposals to reduce the number of tax brackets, enhance the child tax credit and possibly put new limits on popular 401(k) retirement pension plans. Because details of the unfinished tax legislation are unknown, its economic impact is unclear, said Omer Eisner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange in Washington. Hours after the Commerce Department reported stronger-than-expected third quarter U.S. economic growth of 3 percent. Hassett said the data did not undercut the need for tax cuts. He said economic expansion and stronger stock market performance could be undermined if the Republican-controlled Congress fails to enact the tax cuts. “Firms are optimistic both because of regulatory reform but also because they expect corporate tax reform and overall tax reform,” Hassett said. “The thing that I’m worried about is that if those expectations prove to be incorrect, then I would expect business capital spending to go back to a disappointing path and equity markets to decline as well.” Kevin Brady, chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives tax committee, said progress was being made toward satisfying Republicans who have held back support for the tax plan because it could end a deduction for state and local taxes. “I’m hopeful ... we can find a good solution for them,” Brady said.

Asked by reporters whether she wanted to be the top U.S. diplomat, Haley said: “I just don’t want to keep having this conversation. The focus is, I really want to do a good job now in what I’m doing.” “We have a secretary of state. Tillerson’s not going anywhere, so it’s really not been a topic of conversation,” she told reporters in Kinshasa at the end of a week-long trip to Africa. If she was offered the job, she said: “I would say no.” Tillerson, a former chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corp, said on Oct. 4 he had never considered resigning, but failed to address whether he had referred to Trump as a “moron,” as NBC reported. That was a few days after Trump said on Twitter that Tillerson was “wasting his time” trying to negotiate with North Korea after the secretary of state said Washington was directly communicating with Pyongyang on its nuclear and missile programs. More recently Trump has said he has a good relationship with his secretary of state but that Tillerson could be tougher.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is leaning toward nominating Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to be the next head of the U.S. central bank, two sources familiar with the matter said on Friday. The sources cautioned that while Powell had emerged as the leading candidate from a short list of five, Trump had not made a final decision and could always change his mind. “I will be announcing it sometime next week,” Trump said in a video statement on Instagram. “It will be a person who hopefully will do a fantastic job. I have someone very specific in mind and I think everyone will be very impressed.”  Trump has said he has been considering Powell, as well as Stanford University economist John Taylor, for the post. He also has said he has not ruled out renominating current Fed Chair Janet Yellen, whose term expires in February.     He is expected to announce his pick, which would need to win Senate approval, before he departs on a trip to Asia on Nov. 3. The term of current Fed chair Janet Yellen ends in February 2018, though her term as a Federal Reserve Board governor does not expire until 2024. Trump had been working from a short list of five candidates that included his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, and former Fed Governor Kevin Warsh. A senior administration official said on Wednesday that Trump was unlikely to nominate Cohn given the importance of his role in helping to lead efforts to enact tax reform legislation currently being debated in Congress.   Trump has also privately voiced a desire to put his own stamp on the central bank, which has dimmed the prospect of him giving a new term to Yellen, another source said. In an interview with Fox Business Network last Friday, Trump indicated he could nominate both Powell and Taylor for top jobs at the central bank. A vice chair post is currently open.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Friday named 39 Russian defense- and intelligence-related entities under a new sanctions law, belatedly taking a step to enforce legislation passed overwhelmingly by Congress. The law, which President Donald Trump signed on Aug. 2, requires sanctions on individuals who engage in “a significant transaction” with the Russian entities. Friday’s action does not itself impose new sanctions, and determinations will be made on a case by case basis, State Department officials said. Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have complained that Trump has been tardy in enforcing the law, which required the list of Russian entities be ready by Oct. 1. The list includes major Russian arms makers as well as Rosoboronexport, the state-run Russian arms exporter. Also listed is the St. Petersburg-based Special Technology Center, which former President Barack Obama sanctioned in December, saying it played a role in Moscow’s hacking and other interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Russia has denied such meddling. State Department officials, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity, indicated the Trump administration would move carefully in imposing sanctions and dealing with issues such as U.S. allies who buy Russian-made weaponry or spare parts. “There is a significance threshold that would exclude certain things that are less than significant,” one official said. “Obviously we’re going to consider the totality of circumstances.” State Department guidance released on Friday says that in determining whether a transaction is “significant,” officials would weigh its impact on U.S. national security; its size and scope; and the importance of the deal to Russia’s defense and intelligence sector. The law requires Trump to impose sanctions by Jan. 29 on transactions that are found to meet the definition and which took place after he signed the legislation in August. “We’ll be implementing the sanctions legislation robustly, in keeping with our understanding of Congress’ intent and the facts that precipitated that legislation, including interference in our election,” a second State Department official said. The same official did not dispute a report that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had eliminated a department office charged with coordinating economic sanctions. The office traditionally had been led by a senior U.S. diplomat. The official added that individuals throughout the department work on sanctions and that coordination of such work would continue.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Republican head of the tax-writing panel in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Friday progress was being made in efforts to allay concerns among some Republicans about the potential elimination of a federal deduction for state and local income taxes as part of a tax-reform push. Some lawmakers from states where state and local taxes are high and people benefit most from the federal income tax deduction are reluctant to contemplate such an elimination. It would be one of several measures aimed at offsetting lost revenue under sweeping tax cuts planned by President Donald Trump and the Republican leadership in Congress. “We’re working with these lawmakers. We are making progress, but we aren’t there yet,” House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady told Fox News Channel. “I’m hopeful at the end of the day we can find a good solution for them.” A budget blueprint central to Republican efforts to enact the tax cut package - because it will enable easier passage of the package through the Senate - barely squeaked through the House on Thursday, with Democrats solidly opposed and a number of Republicans voting no in an effort to protect the deduction. Republican leaders had sketched out a tax cut plan that would eliminate the tax break, although detailed legislation will not be unveiled until next Wednesday. Brady also said lawmakers were exchanging ideas with Trump over how to handle 401(k) retirement savings plans. In another measure to offset lost revenue, House Republicans have considered eliminating or capping the ability to contribute to the plans on a pre-tax basis, but Trump has said he wants to protect the popular tax-deferred savings program. “We want to increase the amount that you can give to your 401(k) or IRA (individual retirement account), for 401(k)s up to $20,000 or more,” Brady told Fox, without specifying whether that would be on a pre-tax or after-tax basis. “We’re actually exchanging ideas with the president on how we help people save more and save sooner in their lives.” The current cap on pre-tax 401(k) contributions is $18,000 a year, and that is set to rise to $18,500 next year.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States wants a meeting soon aimed at reviving a four-way dialogue between itself, Japan, India and Australia to deepen security cooperation and coordinate alternatives for regional infrastructure financing to that offered by China, a senior U.S. official said on Friday. The so-called “Quad” to discuss and cooperate on security emerged briefly as an initiative a decade ago - much to the annoyance of China, which saw as an attempt by regional democracies to contain its advances. In an interview with Japan’s Nikkei newspaper on Wednesday, Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono proposed reviving the forum, which he said he had discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop on the sidelines of a regional meeting in Manila in August. According to the Nikkei, the purpose would be to secure a peaceful maritime zone from Asia to Africa. It said Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe would officially propose the dialogue partnership to U.S. President Donald Trump on Nov. 6, when the U.S. leader visits Japan as part of an Asian tour that will also take him to China. Alice Wells, Washington’s acting assistant secretary of state for South Asia, told reporters after accompanying Tillerson on a visit to India that Washington was “looking at a working level quadrilateral meeting in the near term.” “The quadrilateral the Japanese foreign minister discussed would be building on a very productive trilateral we have with India and Japan,” she said. Wells said the idea was to bring together countries that share the same values “to reinforce those values in the global architecture.” “As we explore ways to deepen and try to inculcate some of the values - freedom of navigation, maritime security, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, transparency, obviously Australia would be a natural partner in that effort.” Wells rejected the idea the forum would be aimed at containing China, which has alarmed Asia-Pacific countries through its pursuit of territory in the South China Sea and has launched major initiatives to develop regional infrastructure.  She said it would seek to coordinate alternatives for nations seeking investment in infrastructure and economic development, “that don’t include predatory financing or unsustainable debt.” “It’s hard to see a meeting of diplomats from four countries as a plan to contain China,” she said. “It’s a natural progression and convergence of interests between democratic countries in the Indo-Pacific region.” Tillerson said before visiting India that Washington saw room to invite others, including Australia, to join U.S.-India-Japan security cooperation and to create alternatives to Chinese financing that was saddling countries with “enormous” debts and failing to create jobs.

0,True,"October 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump declared the opioid crisis a public health emergency on Thursday, stopping short of a national emergency declaration he promised months ago that would have freed up more federal money. Responding to a growing problem, particularly in rural areas, Trump’s declaration will redirect federal resources and loosen regulations to combat opioid abuse, senior administration officials said.  But it does not result in more money to combat the crisis. Some critics, including Democratic lawmakers, said the declaration was meaningless without additional funding. Republican lawmakers called the president’s declaration an important step in combating the crisis.  “This epidemic is a national health emergency,” Trump, a Republican, said at the White House. “As Americans, we cannot allow this to continue.” Trump, who also called the epidemic a “national shame” and “human tragedy,” was introduced by his wife, Melania, who said she had made fighting the epidemic one of her top priorities as first lady. “This can happen to any of us,” she said.  The president also made a personal reference to addiction in his family by citing his deceased brother Fred, an alcoholic whose advice not to imbibe made an impression on Trump, who does not drink alcohol.   The announcement disappointed some advocates and experts in the addiction fight, who said it was inadequate to fight a scourge that played a role in more than 33,000 deaths in 2015, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The death rate has kept rising, estimates show. Opioids, primarily prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, are fueling the drug overdoses. More than 100 Americans die daily from related overdoses, according to the CDC. A White House commission on the drug crisis had urged Trump to declare a national emergency. On Wednesday, the president told Fox Business Network he would do so. Officials told reporters on the conference call that Federal Emergency Management Agency funds that would have been released under a national emergency are already exhausted from recent storms that struck Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida.  The administration would have to work with Congress to help provide additional funding to address drug abuse, they added. They said they determined that a public health emergency declaration was most appropriate after an expansive review. Under Thursday’s declaration, treatment would be made more accessible for abusers of prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, while ensuring fewer delays in staffing the Department of Health and Human Services to help states grapple with the crisis. Trump said he would discuss stopping the flow of fentanyl, a drug 50 to 100 times more powerful than morphine, with Chinese President Xi Jinping during his visit to Asia next month. In his remarks, Trump said the U.S. Postal Service and Department of Homeland Security were “strengthening the inspection of packages coming into our country to hold back the flood of cheap and deadly fentanyl, a synthetic opioid manufactured in China.” In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had always paid a great deal of attention to international cooperation against narcotics and had listed 23 components of fentanyl as controlled substances, despite not having a fentanyl abuse problem. Trump added he would consider bringing lawsuits against “bad actors” in the epidemic. Several states have sued opioid manufacturers for deceptive marketing. Congress is investigating the business practices of manufacturers.  The president also said the government should focus on teaching young people not to take drugs. “There is nothing desirable about drugs. They’re bad,” he said. Thursday’s declaration allows the Department of Labor to issue grants to help dislocated workers affected by the crisis. HIV/AIDS health funding would also be prioritized for those who need substance abuse treatment, officials said.     As a candidate, Trump promised to address the crisis, including by building a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to stop the flow of illicit drugs, which he touched on in his speech. Additional actions under the move would be announced in coming weeks by various agencies, officials said. ",Trump declares opioids a U.S. public health emergency
0,True,"October 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Thursday said it had belatedly begun informing Congress and others about groups associated with the Russian intelligence and defense sectors as required under a 2017 law tightening sanctions on Russia. The Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law on Aug. 2, among other things imposes sanctions on Russia to punish Moscow because U.S. intelligence agencies concluded Russia carried out a hacking and propaganda campaign to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the allegations.  The law calls on the president to impose sanctions on anyone  he identifies as having engaged “in a significant transaction with a person that is part of, or operates for or on behalf of, the defense or intelligence sectors” of the Russian government. The law required the Trump administration to “specify the persons that are part of, or operate for or on behalf of, the defense and intelligence sectors” of the Russian government by Oct. 1, a deadline the administration missed. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has now authorized the State Department to identify such people or entities, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters. She said notification to Congress, as well as to industry, allies and partners, had begun and that public guidance on the matter would posted on the agency’s website soon, although she suggested this would not happen on Thursday. “We expect to post the full public guidance on state.gov shortly ... a lot of these conversations are still ongoing between Congress, industry, allies and also partners,” Nauert said at a briefing. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker this week said he wanted administration answers about why it failed to meet the deadline for implementing the sanctions on Russia. However, he said he spoke to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan by phone on Thursday and afterward said in a statement that the department’s guidance “is a good first step in responsibly implementing a very complex piece of legislation.”    ",U.S. belatedly begins to comply with Russia sanctions law
0,True,"October 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Twitter Inc on Thursday accused Russian media outlets Russia Today (RT) and Sputnik of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election and banned them from buying ads on its network, after criticism the social network had not done enough to deter international meddling.  RT and Sputnik condemned the decision, saying Twitter had encouraged ad spending with its sales tactics, while Russia’s foreign ministry said the ban was due to U.S. government pressure and that it planned to retaliate.  San Francisco-based Twitter said in an unsigned statement on its website that election meddling is “not something we want” on the social network. It cited a report this year from U.S. intelligence agencies and said it had also done its own investigations of RT and Sputnik. “We did not come to this decision lightly, and are taking this step now as part of our ongoing commitment to help protect the integrity of the user experience on Twitter,” the company said. Twitter, Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google have all recently detected that suspected Russian operatives used their platforms last year to purchase ads and post content that was politically divisive. Russia has denied interfering in the election. Twitter said it would take the estimated $1.9 million it had earned from RT global advertising since 2011 and donate the money “to support external research into the use of Twitter in civic engagement and elections.” The company said it would allow RT and Sputnik to maintain regular, non-ad Twitter accounts in accordance with its rules. RT, an English-language news channel, accused Twitter’s sales staff of pressuring it to spend big on advertising in 2016 ahead of the election.  “The more money RT spent, the bigger the reach to American voters that Twitter would provide,” RT said, describing the Twitter sales pitch. It said it never “pursued an agenda of influencing the U.S. election through any platforms, including Twitter.” Twitter declined to comment on any discussions with advertisers. A former Twitter employee said the sales pitch to RT is similar to what the company uses to lure advertisers to Twitter, which has struggled to turn a profit.  On Thursday, Twitter said it may become profitable for the first time next quarter after slashing expenses and ramping up deals to sell its data to other companies, which could help to break its reliance on advertising for revenue. Facebook and Google did not immediately respond to questions about whether they would limit Russia media ad spending. In April, Reuters reported that RT and Sputnik were part of a plan by Russian President Vladimir Putin to swing the U.S. presidential election to Donald Trump and undermine voters’ faith in the American electoral system, according to three current and four former U.S. officials. On Oct. 19, U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year’s election, introduced legislation to extend rules governing political advertising on broadcast television, radio and satellite to also cover social media. General counsels for Twitter, Facebook and Google will testify on Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House intelligence committees on alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.  “Twitter is wisely positioning itself to be able to tell the committees that the company has taken steps to address the issues raised,” Adam Sharp, a former Twitter executive, told Reuters on Thursday. The Russian foreign ministry said the ban was a “gross violation” by the United States of the guarantees of free speech.  “Retaliatory measures, naturally, will follow,” ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said, according to the RIA news agency. Sputnik, a news agency, said on its website that Twitter’s move was regrettable, “especially now that Russia had vowed retaliatory measures against the U.S. media.”  Some analysts said transparency, rather than a ban, would have been a better approach. Unlike Facebook, Twitter allows anonymous accounts and automated accounts, or bots, making the service more difficult to police.  “Banning any particular person, group or country is just bad policy - in other parts of the world, platforms will come to be viewed as a tool of U.S. or other foreign policy and it will give authoritarian regimes more excuses to ban speech,” Albert Gidari, who as a lawyer has represented tech companies, said in an email. Gidari is now privacy director at Stanford Law School’s Center for Internet and Society.  A U.S. lawmaker, Representative Adam Schiff, applauded Twitter’s move.  “Serving as a platform for free expression does not require assisting foreign powers in their efforts to push propaganda, whether by promoted tweets or other means,” Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said in a statement.

0,True,"October 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional committee on Thursday set a Nov. 2 deadline for the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) to provide information related to its $300 million contract with a small Montana firm to repair damage to the utility’s infrastructure caused by Hurricane Maria. “Specifically, the size and terms of the contract, as well as the circumstances surrounding the contract’s formation, raise questions regarding PREPA’s standard contract awarding procedures,” the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Rob Bishop, said in a letter to PREPA’s executive director, Ricardo Ramos. Media reports that Whitefish Energy Holdings entered the contract with PREPA to fix the utility’s power grid raised questions among Democrats in Congress and others when it was disclosed that the Montana firm won the contract without a competitive bidding process. The two-year-old company had only two full-time employees and was rapidly hiring workers to tackle the job of patching up the destroyed power grid that has left most of the U.S. territory without electricity for weeks following the destructive hurricane. While Bishop’s letter said emergency circumstances could “necessitate” emergency relief contracts, “Transparency and accountability in government contracting, however, is not to be compromised.” Separately, U.S. Representatives including Greg Walden, a Republican, and Frank Pallone, a Democrat, asked Whitefish in a letter to provide documents related to the contract to the Energy and Commerce committee before Nov. 9.    Whitefish founding partner Ken Luce said his company appreciated the efforts to gather information so lawmakers have “confidence in the overall process to support the people of Puerto Rico” and Whitefish’s capabilities.  And two Democratic U.S. senators urged the head of a congressional watchdog office to probe the PREPA contract, saying they were concerned about the bidding process and potential high costs.  Senators Maria Cantwell and Ron Wyden wrote a letter to Eugene Dodaro, the U.S. comptroller general at the non-partisan Government Accountability Office, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. The senators said they were also concerned about reports of “contemporaneous communications between Whitefish and senior members of the federal executive branch, including Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke,” as the contract was being discussed.     A Washington Post report this week said the chief executive of Whitefish, Andy Techmanski, and Zinke acknowledged that they know each other and that one of the secretary’s sons worked at one of Techmanski’s construction sites. Both Zinke’s office and Techmanski said the secretary had no role in Whitefish securing the contract.       The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the senators’ letter.  Puerto Rico Governor Ricardo Rossello has defended the contract saying it was necessary to put workers in place quickly. Whitefish, which has hired workers mostly through subcontracts, has called criticism “unfounded.” ",House panels seek documents on Puerto Rico utility deal
0,True,"October 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday ordered the unveiling of 2,800 documents related to the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy but yielded to pressure from the FBI and CIA to block the release of other records to be reviewed further.  Congress had ordered in 1992 that all remaining sealed files pertaining to the investigation into Kennedy’s death should be fully opened to the public through the National Archives in 25 years, by Oct. 26, 2017, except for those the president authorized for further withholding. Trump had confirmed on Saturday that he would allow for the release of the final batch of once-classified records, amounting to tens of thousands of pages, “subject to the receipt of further information.” But as the deadline neared, the administration decided at the last minute to stagger the final release over the next 180 days while government agencies studied whether any documents should stay sealed or redacted. The law allows the president to keep material under wraps if it is determined that harm to intelligence operations, national defense, law enforcement or the conduct of foreign relations would outweigh the public’s interest in full disclosure. More than 2,800 uncensored documents were posted immediately to the National Archives website on Thursday evening - a staggering, disparate cache that news outlets began poring through seeking new insights into a tragedy that has been endlessly dissected for decades by investigators, scholars and conspiracy theorists. The rest will be released “on a rolling basis,” with “redactions in only the rarest of circumstances,” by the end of the review on April 26, 2018, the White House said in a statement. In a memo to government agency heads, Trump said the American people deserved as much access as possible to the records. “Therefore, I am ordering today that the veil finally be lifted,” he wrote, adding that he had no choice but to accept the requested redactions for now.  A Central Intelligence Agency spokesman told Reuters that every single one of approximately 18,000 remaining CIA records in the collection would ultimately be released, with just 1 percent of the material left redacted. CIA Director Mike Pompeo was a lead advocate in arguing to the White House for keeping some materials secret, one senior administration official said. While Kennedy was killed over half a century ago, the document file included material from investigations during the 1970s through the 1990s. Intelligence and law enforcement officials argued their release could thus put at risk some more recent “law enforcement equities” and other materials that still have relevance, the official said. Trump was resistant but “acceded to it with deep insistence that this stuff is going to be reviewed and released in the next six months,” the official added. Academics who have studied Kennedy’s slaying on Nov. 22, 1963, said they expected nothing in the final batch of files would alter the official conclusion of investigators that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone assassin who fired on the president’s open limousine that day in Dallas from an upper window of the Texas Book Depository building overlooking the motorcade route. They likewise anticipated that the latest releases would do little to quell long-held conspiracy theories that the 46-year-old Democratic president’s killing was organized by the Mafia, by Cuba, or a cabal of rogue agents. Of the roughly 5 million pages of JFK assassination-related records held by the National Archives, 88 percent have been available to the public without restriction since the late 1990s, and 11 percent more have been released with sensitive portions redacted. Only about 1 percent have remain withheld in full, according to the National Archives. Thousands of books, articles, TV shows and films have explored the idea that Kennedy’s assassination was the result of an elaborate conspiracy. None have produced conclusive proof that Oswald, who was fatally shot by a nightclub owner two days after killing Kennedy, worked with anyone else, although they retain a powerful cultural currency. “My students are really skeptical that Oswald was the lone assassin,” said Patrick Maney, a professor of history at Boston College. “It’s hard to get our minds around this, that someone like a loner, a loser, could on his own have murdered Kennedy and changed the course of world history. But that’s where the evidence is.” Kennedy’s assassination was the first in a string of politically motivated killings, including those of his brother Robert F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., that stunned the United States during the turbulent 1960s. He remains one of the most admired U.S. presidents.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson spoke on Thursday with Myanmar’s army chief and expressed concern over reported atrocities against Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state, the U.S. State Department said in a statement. Tillerson urged the army chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, to support the Myanmar government in ending the violence and allowing the safe return of ethnic Rohingya who have fled the area, the statement said. More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled Rakhine state in Buddhist-majority Myanmar, mostly to neighboring Bangladesh, since security forces responded to Rohingya militants’ attacks on Aug. 25 by launching a crackdown. The State Department is considering formally declaring the crackdown on Rohingya Muslims to be ethnic cleansing. In his call with Min Aung Hlaing, Tillerson also urged the Myanmar military to facilitate humanitarian aid for displaced people, allow media access and cooperate with a U.N. investigation into allegations of human rights abuses, the State Department said. Pressure has mounted for a tougher U.S. response to the Rohingya crisis ahead of President Donald Trump’s maiden visit to Asia next month when he will attend a summit of Southeast Asian countries, including Myanmar, in Manila.

0,True,"October 26, 2017 ",politicsNews,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former CIA director James Woolsey pitched a $10 million contract to two Turkish businessmen to help discredit a controversial U.S.-based cleric while Woolsey was an adviser to Donald Trump’s election campaign, three people familiar with the proposal said.     Just eight days after formally joining Trump’s campaign as an adviser on national security issues, Woolsey met on Sept. 20, 2016 with businessmen Ekim Alptekin and Sezgin Baran Korkmaz over lunch at the Peninsula Hotel in New York, they said.      Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, proposed a lobbying and public relations campaign targeting Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who lives in Pennsylvania.     Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan accuses Gulen of instigating a failed coup in July 2016 and wants him extradited to Turkey to face trial. Gulen has denied any role in the coup.     In an email memo seen by Reuters, Woolsey and Miller sketched a plan to “draw attention to the cleric’s possible role in the coup attempt” and encourage an official investigation into his activities.     Alptekin, an ally of Erdogan, had already agreed through one of his companies to a $600,000 contract with the consulting firm of Michael Flynn to research Gulen. Flynn was also a Trump campaign adviser and later became his national security adviser before being fired in February.       Woolsey was a member of Flynn’s firm, the Flynn Intel Group, according to a Justice Department filing by the firm and an archive of the company’s website, although a spokesman for Woolsey disputed that characterization, saying he was an unpaid adviser and his affiliation was “loosely defined.”      At the Sept. 20 meeting, Miller said she and Woolsey were in a better position than Flynn to influence decision-makers about Gulen’s alleged role in the coup, according to Alptekin and two other people familiar with the discussion.     Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal, and Woolsey and Miller did not win the contract in any event.     But the previously undisclosed meeting shows for the first time that two Trump aides were competing with each other to win the lucrative business deal with Alptekin. The deal with Flynn is now being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller as part of his wider probe into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russians who tried to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.   Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment.     Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey and Miller, said his clients were not under investigation. Flynn is a central figure in Mueller’s investigation because of conversations he had with then-Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year and because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did for Alptekin. In that filing, Flynn’s lawyer, Robert Kelner, said the work done for Alptekin’s company “could be construed to have principally benefited the republic of Turkey.”       Flynn was fired as national security adviser in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Kislyak.     Franks described the Sept. 20 meeting as “unremarkable” and said Miller could not locate the email memo or remember writing it.     He also said Woolsey had pursued with Turkish interests an “economic development proposal in the wake of the coup that centered around reassuring folks that Turkey was a safe place to do business” but that the project’s focus was not on Gulen.      Alptekin said Woolsey and Miller pursued his business at the Sept. 20 meeting, pitching the project to target Gulen, but he decided to stick to his contract with Flynn’s firm.      Kelner declined to comment for this story.     The White House did not respond to a request for comment. The disclosure in March of Flynn’s contract to discredit Gulen sparked intense media scrutiny of people who had worked with Flynn, including Woolsey.      Shortly after, Woolsey alleged in media interviews that Flynn and others had, at a Sept. 19, 2016 meeting in New York, discussed with Turkey’s foreign and energy ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States and to Turkey.      Flynn has denied through a spokesman ever discussing such a plan. Alptekin also denied it was ever discussed and said Woolsey’s claim was “all the more astounding” because he had sought Alptekin’s business at a meeting the following day.     “His story is fiction,” Alptekin told Reuters.     Franks said Woolsey stands by his account of the meeting.     Woolsey first proposed the $10 million project to Korkmaz, the second Turkish businessman, at a meeting in California in August 2016. The proposal was outlined in an email sent from Miller to Woolsey on Aug. 18, printed out and shown by Woolsey to Korkmaz, who then forwarded it on to Alptekin.  Korkmaz, who had known Woolsey for some years, invited Woolsey to the meeting, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Korkmaz told Woolsey that he was looking for someone who could handle a lobbying and public relations project related to Gulen.      Korkmaz and Alptekin have no business ties but knew each other through a U.S-Turkey trade group, according to two people with knowledge of their relationship. Anil Leylek, a spokeswoman for Korkmaz’s company, declined to comment.     Franks confirmed the August meeting but described it as “brief” and “not a pitch.”     Woolsey and Miller’s proposal included getting Washington insiders like then-Senator Jeff Sessions, who is now Trump’s attorney general, to co-author articles on the situation in Turkey, engaging with influential lawmakers such as Republican Senator Bob Corker, and getting Woolsey on Fox News and CNN, the memo said.      “The cost of this engagement will be $10,000,000,” it said.     Woolsey, who led the CIA for two years under former President Bill Clinton, joined the Trump campaign in September. He was on the transition team after Trump’s election victory in November but he stepped down in January.     Franks said Woolsey was an unpaid adviser to the campaign, had no obligation to report any efforts to pursue work for Turkish interests, and was now being smeared.     “With growing speculation that indictments could be handed down soon, it’s not a surprise that others are attempting to accomplish in the press what they cannot in the grand jury room,” Franks added.

0,True,"October 27, 2017 ",politicsNews,"SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis flew into Seoul on Friday for annual defense talks as tensions with North Korea climb ahead of a visit to the region next month by President Donald Trump. Mattis has emphasized diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful solution to the crisis during his week-long trip to Asia, even as North Korea’s weapons tests and bellicose verbal exchanges between Pyongyang and Washington stoke fears of an armed confrontation. “I carried the message that the more we do together today the greater the chance for enduring peace in the future,” Mattis said earlier this week, looking back at three days of meetings with Asian defense chiefs in the Philippines.  “That’s really what it was all about – to keep the (North Korea) effort firmly in the diplomatic lane for resolution.” Even before landing in Seoul, Mattis held a meeting in the Philippines on Monday with his South Korea and Japanese counterparts, where they agreed to keep bolstering intelligence sharing about North Korea and enhance exercises.  “Now we got to do the ‘roll up our sleeves’ (work) and do the pragmatic planning and coordination,” he told reporters. Japanese Defence Minister Itsunori Onodera warned the threat from North Korea has grown to a “critical and imminent level”. CIA chief Mike Pompeo said last week North Korea could be only months away from developing the ability to hit the United States with nuclear weapons, a scenario Trump has vowed to prevent.  U.S. intelligence experts say Pyongyang believes it needs the weapons to ensure its survival and have been skeptical about diplomatic efforts, focusing on sanctions, to get Pyongyang to denuclearize. The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on seven North Korean individuals and three entities for “flagrant” human rights abuses, including killings, torture, forced labor and the hunting down of asylum seekers abroad. Mattis is expected to meet South Korean leaders on Friday before he joins the top U.S. military officer, Marine General Joseph Dunford, at the annual “Security Consultative Meeting” with South Korea’s military on Saturday. The visit comes just before Trump’s departs on Nov. 3 to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines, a trip which is expected to be dominated by the nuclear and ballistic missile threat posed by North Korea. Trump, in a speech last month at the United Nations, threatened to destroy North Korea if necessary to defend itself and allies. Kim has blasted Trump as “mentally deranged.” Despite the rhetoric, White House officials say Trump is looking for a peaceful resolution of the standoff. But all options, including military ones, are on the table.  Mattis, for his part, dismissed the idea that U.S. allies were confused about the U.S. approach, noting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s recent trip to Beijing to get China to do more to pressure Pyongyang.  China is North Korea’s biggest trading partner.  “Do we have military options in defense for attack, if our allies are attacked? Of course we do. But everyone is out for a peaceful resolution,” Mattis told reporters traveling with him earlier this week. “No one’s rushing for war.” ",Mattis visits Seoul for defense talks as tensions climb

They said that this decision was made because Trump s reaction to Nazis marching in the streets and the death of Heather Heyer was  lacking in moral leadership and empathy for the victims of racial and religious hatred. We have concluded that President Trump s statements during and after the tragic events in Charlottesville are so lacking in moral leadership and empathy for the victims of racial and religious hatred that we cannot organize such a call this year,  the rabbis wrote. The President s words have given succor to those who advocate anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia,  they wrote.  Responsibility for the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, including the death of Heather Heyer, does not lie with many sides but with one side: the Nazis, alt-right and white supremacists who brought their hate to a peaceful community. They must be roundly condemned at all levels. In the days following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left three people dead, Trump insisted that  many sides  were to blame for the violence. The rabbis concluded by saying that they would  pray that President Trump will recognize and remedy the grave error he has made in abetting the voices of hatred.   They added that they will also  pray that those who traffic in anti-Semitism, racism, and xenophobia will see that there is no place for such pernicious philosophies in a civilized society.

This apparently occurred when an intermediary brought Steele s findings to the FBI following the release of hacked Democratic National Committee emails, a move later found to be part of Russia s effort to sway the election and a notion the President has repeatedly slammed as  fake news.

I turned 15 during the brief skirmish known as Operation Desert Shield, and even then, I wasn t skipping school to go to the mall. I was spray painting anti-war slogans on every concrete surface in my little town I could get away with.Okay, I was going to the mall too.That last part is important because what I mean to convey is that while I have always opposed war in every way, I was also a pretty realistic kid. Even then, I understood that my complaints lodged in Krylon  on the side of a bridge were mostly meaningless. In that context, I approach The Left who are even further to the left than me: Yes, we are embroiled in the longest war in the history of the United States in Afghanistan. Yes, we are  fighting  an invisible War On Terror. Yes, I hate those things. I also understand that the complaints I now lodge in Facebook posts, tweets, and these articles are like colored mists on the bridges and walls of war.In the end, the fury of war can only be mitigated by absolutely minimizing the innocent victims of it. But how can that be accomplished in a war against ISIS, an enemy that recruits civilians, uses them as human shields and otherwise disregards humanity in the name of jihad?There are those on the left that condemn President Barack Obama for increasing the number of drone strikes initiated by the United States in the Middle East and South Asia. And those on the right simply condemn him for existing. So I will stand with whoever has identified with me so far here and give credit to our 44th President for mitigating the level of civilian deaths in those ongoing wars using tactical precision.I like to think that Barack Obama opposes war in the way that I do: Absolutely, but if it is happening, it must be done in a way that keeps the most civilians safe.By contrast, Donald Trump does not understand war. He certainly does not oppose it. I believe that he sees it only in the abstract: An ongoing effort to  win  at all costs, like everything in his life. Almost like war is a jacket and hat you put on for the cameras.The numbers bear this theory out.

That is a simple fact. But even if you go back to the New York Times link I provided above ( the number of drone strikes ), you can see that precision can mitigate them. Bush ordered 50 drone strikes which killed 296 terrorists and 195 civilians   a 40% civilian casualty rate. Under Obama, the strikes went up, but the casualty rate went down: Ten times as many strikes, more than ten times as many dead terrorists, but less than twice as many civilian casualties. Just over 11%, at the time of that report.Like his presidency, Trump s war is messy.

1,Fake,"August 22, 2017",News,"Donald Trump has never been Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell s (R-KY) favorite person. That uneasy relationship deteriorated further in recent days and weeks, as Trump proceeded to openly mock and humiliate McConnell, blaming him for everything from the failed attempts to repeal Obamacare to the entire situation of the fractured GOP s stalled agenda. Now, since Trump had such a disgraceful response to the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville that resulted in the death of anti-racism activist Heather Heyer and the injuries of countless others, it seems that Trump and McConnell are engaged in what the New York Times is calling their own little, quote,  cold war. According to the new bombshell report, Trump doesn t even talk to McConnell   the one most important man in the legislative branch when it comes to getting his agenda passed. The New York Times reports: The relationship between President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, has disintegrated to the point that they have not spoken to each other in weeks, and Mr. McConnell has privately expressed uncertainty that Mr. Trump will be able to salvage his administration after a series of summer crises.What was once an uneasy governing alliance has curdled into a feud of mutual resentment and sometimes outright hostility.The article further suggests that when Trump and McConnell were speaking, Trump didn t just keep his taunts to the usual juvenile derision via Twitter. No, apparently, on August 9th, McConnell and Trump had some kind of conversation, and Trump could not help going after McConnell to his face. There are no details regarding exactly what was said, but knowing Trump, it was likely pretty scathing and humiliating for McConnell, who seems to consider himself your typical dignified grown man. He is likely simply done with Trump s playground bully behavior and is no longer going to dignify Trump s ignorance and taunts with responses.It also doesn t help that McConnell s wife, Elaine Chao, is Trump s Transportation Secretary. She is an immigrant, and arrived from Taiwan as a child, speaking no English. Under Trump s new immigration plans, she would never have been allowed into this country. Further, to top it all off, Secretary Chao had to be humiliated standing next to Trump during his Charlottesville tirade, in which he defended white supremacists. Think about that   how it must have made McConnell feel to see his wife being used that way in such a despicable, bigoted, and unhinged Trump rant.All of this has resulted in much more criticism than one would expect from Mitch McConnell in public, but, according to the Times, McConnell is much more angry with Trump than he is letting on, and he is even wondering if Trump will be the GOP s leader for much longer, given his recent behavior. Again, from the New York Times:Mr. McConnell has fumed over Mr. Trump s regular threats against fellow Republicans and criticism of Senate rules, and questioned Mr. Trump s understanding of the presidency in a public speech. Mr. McConnell has made sharper comments in private, describing Mr. Trump as entirely unwilling to learn the basics of governing.In offhand remarks, Mr. McConnell has expressed a sense of bewilderment about where Mr. Trump s presidency may be headed, and has mused about whether Mr. Trump will be in a position to lead the Republican Party into next year s elections and beyond, according to people who have spoken to him directly.All in all, those two might never speak again. The thing is, though, Donald Trump has severely underestimated Mitch McConnell s power. The GOP took a chance and hitched their wagon to this ignorant, incompetent orange fool because their voters left them no choice. However, they now clearly regret it   and said regret just might be inching toward hastening Trump s removal from office.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", NYT Bombshell: Trump And McConnell Not Speaking; McConnell Questioning Trump’s GOP Future

1,Fake,"August 22, 2017",News,"What would you do if someone kept track of everything you ever said? Most of us aren t in a position to have their every utterance monitored, but if we were, we might actually, you know, watch what we said. Especially if we knew that the people keeping track were specifically looking for lies, backtracking, flip-flopping, and repetition of all of the above.As soon as someone runs for President, however, they have to know that at the very least the media will be tracking their statements. Which means two things: Donald Trump doesn t give a shit about telling the truth, and he knows that his supporters will always think he s telling the truth, no matter how ridiculous his statements are.That s the only conclusion I can draw from Tuesday s Washington Post article, in which the running tally of lies has now surpassed a thousand in these first seven months of Trump s presidency.Many of Trump s prevarications can be chalked up to repeating debunked claims   the logic, of course, being that even if the president didn t know a thing wasn t true the first time he said it, if it s completely debunked and he repeats it, he s lying. And lying in and of itself speaks volumes to Donald Trump s character. But the kinds of lies he tells almost say more about who he is than the simple fact that he tells them.Take for example his many claims of accomplishments: The long and short of it is, he has none. When he touts the economy or jobs or the stock market, not only is he claiming responsibility for things that have nothing to do with his policies, but he s flip-flopping on his prior opinions that those things were in a  bubble  under the last president. When he says he s  bringing back jobs,  he often cites Wal-Mart, or Ford, or ExxonMobil, among others   all companies whose plans for expansion predate Trump s inauguration.Some of the lies are more nefarious in nature. It is well-documented that there is no evidence of voter fraud or widespread voting by undocumented immigrants, yet he continues to make the claim. It is indisputably untrue that Hillary Clinton was in any way responsible for a uranium extraction deal with Russia that gave the hostile country a significant stake in US rights. Why is it untrue? Because Hillary Clinton has never been president. Why Donald Trump or his supporters are stupid enough to think a Cabinet member can unilaterally negotiate with a foreign country over US interests is baffling. Does Trump think Rex Tillerson has the power to sell our oil drilling rights to Russia without his approval?The article puts the current number of Trump s lies at 1,057, notwithstanding any tweets from today, of course. In 214 days, 1,057 lies is an average of 4.94 lies per day. By this time next year, if his average holds, Trump will have lied to America nearly three thousand times.But will his supporters care?Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images", Trump Told More Than A Thousand Documented Lies In Only Seven Months (DETAILS)
1,Fake,"August 22, 2017",News,"In House Speaker Paul Ryan s Ayn Randish views, the way to fix the economy is by starving the poor to death. It s also totally going to help the poor   somehow. Ryan, a Catholic, was challenged by a nun during his first town hall in two years on Monday evening. After angry constituents filled the room, Sister Erica Jordan, a Dominican nun and retired school principal took Ryan s faith and his actions toward the poor to task. I know that you re a Catholic, as am I. And it seems to me that most of the Republicans in the Congress are not willing to stand with the poor and working class, as evidenced in the recent debates about health care and the anticipated tax reform,  Sister Jordan said.  So I d like to ask how you see yourself upholding the Church s social teaching that has the idea that God is always on the side of the poor and dispossessed, as should we be. In response, Ryan said,  Sister, you may   this may come as a surprise to you, but I completely agree with you. Where we may disagree is on how to achieve that goal. As you know, we all exercise prudential judgment in practicing our faith. And for me, the preferential option for the poor, which is something that s a key tenet of the Catholic faith, that means upward mobility, that means economic growth, that means equality of opportunity,  he continued.  That to me means working with this guy over here at Gateway Tech to make sure that we can close the skills gap, to make sure that every person who wants a career and job can get the benefits. Except that Ryan is wrong but at least he s consistent. Republicans do not want to make higher education affordable so the  skills gap  claim doesn t hold water. The poor are being marginalized and misaligned, in many ways, because a lot of the programs that we have, well-intentioned as they may be, are discouraging and disincentivizing work,  he continued. I think we need to change our approach on fighting poverty,  he said without one bit of irony.  Instead of measuring success on how much money we spend or how many programs we create or how many people on those programs, let s measure success and poverty on outcomes.

1,Fake,"August 22, 2017",News,"White supremacists have been emboldened by Donald Trump from the moment he came down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced his bid for the White House by branding all immigrants of Mexican descent rapists and criminals. That travesty of a campaign continued in that vein, as has this sorry excuse of a  presidency.  Trump knows that these people think they have a friend in him (and they do, honestly), so he refuses to disavow them.The latest debacle in that direction is, of course, Trump s disgraceful equivocation between neo-Nazis and their counter protesters during the violent white nationalist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia. Of course, that gathering claimed the life of Heather Heyer, a brave activist standing up against hate.After Trump s remarks, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke was alight with praise. It turns out there s a reason for that, and it is much more sinister than those of us who are not within the white power movement to really comprehend. There is one person who does, though: Derek Black, a former white nationalist and the son of Don Black, the founder of the infamous neo-Nazi website Stormfront.The younger Black warns that Trump s heightened flirtation with Nazis and his legitimizing of their message via equivocation with counter protesters is really making things much worse. At first, the white nationalists  message wasn t getting out due to the news being focused on all of the violence. According to Black, though, that all changed with Trump. Speaking to New York Times writer Michael Barbaro, Black said of Trump s response to Charlottesville: He salvaged their message. The message that they were trying to get out was that tearing down Robert E Lee s statue is an assault on white culture, so if you think that tearing down REL s statue is the wrong choice then these are your guys. But then amidst all the violence and the chaos, I think that got lost   you re not going to follow those people even if you believe that. But then in [Trump s] message, saying these are good people because they re fighting for something that a lot of people believe in, he salvaged the message that they wanted to spread, which is that if you believe this too and maybe you re on the edge about whether this is a fringe movement or not, Donald Trump thinks we re fine. And that is just yet. It is why they are wearing khakis and polos now instead of hoods. It is why they are re-branding themselves the so-called  alt-right.  It is why they are even telling people who come to their rallies to look  sexy    so that they can disassociate from uneducated, mouthbreathing rednecks who everyone mocks and no one takes seriously. They want to make sure this is someone who could be your cookie cutter suburban family, just living next door, and you d be none the wiser. That s why it is so important to keep this a fringe group in the minds of everyone, regardless of whether their politics are left-wing or right-wing. Black further explains: It s just impossible to say what will happen in the future. Maybe nothing. But the point of that rally was to try to recruit people, to try to grow. And if you were on the fence about whether you should get involved in that stuff or not, the president s OK is the biggest thing that s ever happened. That s why what Trump is doing here is so dangerous. It s why we all need to MAKE SURE that white supremacy, no matter how it is dressed up, is NEVER normalized. Ever. That will be the job of all of us, because clearly, that messaging will never come from the White House.Thank you, Derek Black, for denouncing your family s hateful beliefs, and speaking out in a unique way to counter this kind of hate.Featured image via Twitter", Stormfront Founder’s Son Sounds Alarm About Trump And Nazis: ‘He Salvaged Their Message’

After all, this is a section of the House of Representatives dedicated to protecting the interests and rights of Black Americans, and Trump is a lifelong open and avowed racist. However, they have, for the most part, seemed to stop short of calling for Trump s removal   with the exception of Rep. Maxine Waters, who is, of course, in a league all her own.This level of restraint being exercised by the majority of this powerful group of lawmakers has definitely changed as of late, though. Ever since Trump s disgraceful response to the horrific events in Charlottesville at a rally of neo-Nazis that resulted in countless injuries and the death of a brave young woman, it seems that the Black Caucus is done playing. They want Trump out of office, posthaste. During a conference call held with the press on Monday, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) said of Trump: You can make an argument based on pure competency and fitness to serve, and that s the conversation the caucus will have. Am I concerned about high crimes and misdemeanors? Absolutely. Am I concerned about this president s fitness to serve? Absolutely. Richmond also indicated that Charlottesville was the last straw when it came to giving Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether or not he really has the concerns of Black America at heart. Granted, all of this is a pipe dream for now. The GOP will criticize Trump until the cows come home, but they sure as hell won t do anything about him.

Presumably, the voters of Montana thought Jacobs had it coming, or perhaps they re so committed to their political party that even an assault charge won t deter them from voting for a GOP candidate.At the time, the Tea Party lawmaker protested the judge s order that he be booked and fingerprinted, as well as have his photo taken for a mug shot. His lawyers argued that the judge didn t have the authority to order the proceedings since he was never actually handcuffed and arrested formally   a feat he pulled off by coincidentally being the candidate the local Sheriff had made political donations to during his campaign.Now, despite his legal team s argument that he was exempt because he was only charged with a misdemeanor, a judge has ordered that Gianforte turn himself in by September 15th for booking on the charge. If the congressman doesn t comply, the judge said, he will be held in contempt of court.Although Gianforte has paid his fines, apologized to Jacobs, and donated $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, he has yet to complete his community service. There is no word whether he has followed through on the anger management classes he was ordered to attend.Practically speaking, a mugshot should worry the congressman when it comes time for reelection.

I don t even believe it s a year off. According to his calculations, it would cut the S&P 500 Index in half, to 1212, and the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average would collapse to 10,837.Paul noted that there s a lot of chaos in Washington right now, with an  unpredictable president  and those who are inclined to  tear him apart  but if the market takes that big of a tumble, he doesn t see it as Trump s fault. It s all man-made. It s not the fault of Donald Trump in the last week. If the market crashes tomorrow and we have a great depression, he didn t do it in six months.

Paul said people could avoid   and even benefit from   the collapse by purchasing Stansberry s  Survival Blueprint  for weathering the coming catastrophe for $49.50.Source: CNNThe only thing Ron Paul hates more than regulations and the Federal Reserve, is a more diverse society. He s a long-avowed racist who was never a fan of President Obama.

According to another blog post, Obama is still part of that deep state.A 50 percent drop in the stock market would be disastrous for our economy, but as I mentioned, Paul is not an economist. He arguably predicted the real estate crash, but so did a lot of economists. Paul, like his buddy Alex Jones, is full of doomsday predictions and he has books to sell.

Because, OF COURSE it s Obama s fault. Everything is always Obama s fault. I m not saying it is true, but I am suggesting that it is completely plausible, Bryan Zollinger, a state representative for Idaho Falls, wrote on social media. We know that many protesters were Soros funded and we also know that Donald Trump is not a racist. The man was in the public spotlight for 20+ years with zero allegations of racism,  Zollinger continued, clearly ignoring the reality and hanging onto alternative facts.

The conflagration in Charlottesville is beginning to feel like a set-up, perhaps weeks or months in the planning,  the author of the article wrote.  We know that Obama and his inner circle have set up a war room in his D.C. home to plan and execute resistance to the Trump administration and his legislative agenda. The Idaho Statesman contacted Zollinger to see just what he had to say for himself and his response was just as pathetic as you d expect. In hindsight, maybe it was a mistake to post it,  he said.

1,Fake,"August 21, 2017",News,"Back when conservative politics were actually political, rather than social, there was a guy by the actual real name of Grover Norquist who summed up the aim of Republican politicians:I don t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.Yes, back in the days before Nazis invaded America, Republicans and neo-conservatives focused on just three things. They wanted endless war, tax breaks for the rich, and to dismantle government regulations. Norquist s quote is from 2001, but it sounds a little like he s been skulking around the White House or something because the actual conservatives surrounding Donald Trump appear to be pushing back to that agenda.Oh, and speaking of drowning, that s what happens when you remove safety standards   those mean old nasty gub mint regulations. So why would anyone do that? Well, the short answer is money. It s always money, and fewer regulations mean faster, cheaper work. Normally, a politician can t come out and just say  We re getting rid of safety so rich people can have more money.  But Trump can, because his base is made up of equal parts Nazis, people too busy making Biblical excuses for him to notice, and just plain dumbasses.There wasn t really a chance to test this version of the  shoot someone on 5th Avenue  theory, though. Trump s announcement that he was revoking rules protecting the environment in order to speed up cheap infrastructure was cloaked by his simultaneous defense of the Nazis who murdered Heather Heyer in Charlottesville.The rule change that delivers on the promise of this article s headline is one that used to require federal construction to account for rising sea levels when planning and building a project. That s great for constructing a highway that should take three years in less than one. It s not so great for the people living next to it, or the cities it runs through. The change is to an Obama rule that mandated construction two feet above future flood levels, which means that without that requirement, those fast, cheap roads could be underwater following even a mild natural disaster.FEMA has a few things to say about flooding   that it s the leading cause of death among natural disasters in America, that 85% of all emergency declarations are due to floods, that it costs the government billions to recover from major flooding   but why not take it from me? I know from floods: I live in a town that used to flood every single year. Until our city hunkered down and made some riverfront construction rules, that is. The first year that I moved to this tiny hamlet in the Pacific Northwest, I found myself sandbagging a river with my new neighbors by November. My roommates and I ended up at one of their parents  house 10 miles away, because the water came four feet up the stairs to our apartment.Why did I live in the floodplain? Because I was poor. In fact, people in relative or severe poverty make up the largest percentage of those who live in the path of floods. So it s not only states that will have to pay for flooding damage due to this rule reversal. The hardest-hit by this will be those least able to recover from it.Featured image via Michael B.

Instead, President Trump had a simple three-word reaction for journalists    That s too bad.  The Commander in Chief reportedly didn t even offer any further comment for the media, instead taking to his preferred platform, Twitter, to send his condolences to those involved in the collision, offering the stock-standard  thoughts and prayers  response, but very little else.Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway. https://t.co/DQU0zTRXNU  Donald J.

1,Fake,"August 21, 2017",News,"Donald Trump has been wasting taxpayer dollars on his personal vacations, protection for his giant golden tower in New York, security at his golf clubs, and pretty much everything else you can imagine ever since he assumed office, but if you needed an example of how bad things are we can t even afford to pay the Secret Service agents protecting him anymore.CNBC reports that more than 1,000 agents have  already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year  thanks to the  crushing workload  Donald Trump has brought them.The Secret Service has a big job with the Trump family. Not only do they have to protect him as he jaunts from golf course to golf course, but they are also forced to protect his sniveling children on their business trips both in the United States and abroad. The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,  Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles said in an interview.  I can t change that. I have no flexibility. The Trump family is such a big problem that Alles says that without more funding, he won t even be able to pay agents for work they have already done:The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump s first term.But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency. I don t see this changing in the near term,  Alles said.As the Trump family continues to bleed the country dry with their constant vacations and business trips   all of which require Secret Service protection   Congress is actually considering giving them more money to flush down the toilet as they are forced to pay for hotel rooms, travel, and even $60,000 (and growing) in golf cart rentals.The solution isn t to give the Trump family more money. It s time for Congress to take action to limit travel or pass legislation that would exempt personal vacations and business trips for the President s children from requiring Secret Service protection once the agency s budget has been exhausted.It s time for the Trump family to begin living within the country s means.Featured image via Getty Images/Alex wong", Secret Service Officially Can’t Afford To Pay Agents Thanks To Trump’s Constant Golf Trips
1,Fake,"August 20, 2017",News,"This week s chaotic news cycle was mostly dominated by Donald Trump s disgraceful response to the violence perpetuated by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other far-right hate groups in Charlottesville, Virginia. However, that news cycle had a great big exclamation point at the end of it on Friday, when it was announced that Trump s white supremacist Chief Strategist, Stephen K. Bannon would be ousted. Of course, Bannon quickly returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and promised war. Now, we are seeing just what he meant.Everyone remembers the insane interview in which Bannon promised to continue pushing his twisted ideology from outside the White House. He told the Weekly Standard, a conservative publication that has long been critical of Trump, in part: I feel jacked up. Now I m free. I ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said,  it s Bannon the Barbarian.  I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There s no doubt. I built a f***ing machine at Breitbart. And now I m about to go back, knowing what I know, and we re about to rev that machine up. And rev it up we will do. Now, aside from the insanity of that remark, it seems that Bannon is just as much of a dangerous lunatic as we all knew him to be. His only loyalties lie with his white supremacist agenda. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that he has already begun attacking Trump s National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster in the pages of Breitbart. This weekend, the right-wing rag ran a story that featured the following headline: H.R. McMaster Endorsed Book That Advocates Quran-Kissing Apology Ceremonies. The attack charges that McMaster refuses to adequately condemn Islam, which is something of a requirement in pro-Trump circles. Where do they get this evidence? Well, because McMaster allegedly supported a military manual that said not to offend Muslims by desecrating their holy book, the Qu ran. Of course, the radical right only thinks that Christians deserve any respect whatsoever.This is likely just a jumping off point for Breitbart s attacks on McMaster now that Bannon is out of the White House. They will likely go after General Kelly as well. After all, it was known that neither of the Generals was fond of Bannon and the combative and chaotic nature of his White House tenure. Despite the messages coming out of the White House, it is widely believed that General Kelly is the one who actually was able to get Trump to get rid of him.All in all, Bannon s return to Breitbart will likely mean heightened chaos in the White House, and therefore in the nation.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Bannon Takes His ‘Weapons’ At Breitbart; Smears ‘Quran Kissing’ McMaster In Scathing Hit Piece

His horrible responses to the Neo-nazi/KKK/White Supremacist hate rally in Charlottesville, Virginia proves that he s only concerned with a tiny portion of the United States, and that s his frightening and adoring base.While Trump s approval ratings continue to fall among most Americans, his base is lapping up Trump s attempts at spurring on racial division.A GOP strategist working campaigns in red and purple states said that while support for Trump generally declined slightly since Charlottesville, support rose among his base, after a decline last month because of the failure on health care and revelations about the Russia investigation. This strategist said many Trump supporters applaud the president s continuing desire to shake up Washington, favor his economic priorities and admire his willingness to speak his mind.Source: Washington PostPolitically, this is stupid.But he said Trump has nonetheless created a longer-term risk.  What he s doing that s harmful is he s removing people from the persuadable audience, and that s dangerous,  he said.  He s taken an event where he could have added 5 percent of people to the persuadable universe and [instead] he s dumped out 10 percent of them. Trump doesn t care, though. The sycophantic worship is far more important to Trump than any sort of reelection strategy and it s certainly more important to him than the future of the Republican Party   a party that s only in office because of gerrymandering, voter suppression and really undemocratic (both small and big  D ) campaign finance laws.For Trump, appealing to the worst in humanity is that only strategy that works and there is absolutely no sign he ll be letting up on it anytime soon. In fact, the now ousted Steve Bannon, back at the helm of the white supremacist site Breitbart, is vowing to use his platform to keep Trump focused on his nationalist agenda.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", The One Major Reason Trump Won’t Give Up On His Support For White Supremacists

The former reality show star is seven months into the job and he s still in campaign mode, holding ego-rallies while bringing up  Crooked  Hillary Clinton on Twitter in order to deflect from his scandal-plagued administration. But Trump s failure to directly blame the Nazis who stormed the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia in his name while carrying torches and shouting  Blood and soil,  a Nazi Germany era slogan and  Jews will not replace us!  has resulted in a backlash of epic proportions. The Alt-Righters are his people and instead of denouncing them for the murder of a Heather Heyer, 32, while leaving 19 others injured, he blamed  both sides. That said, the GOP gives three options in their latest poll which is titled,  Official Presidential Job Performance Poll. How would you rate President Trump s job performance so far?  the  poll  asks.Your choices are:Great.Good.Okay.Other.We re not saying that you should take the poll (you should take the poll) but that  other  option is screaming for attention. According to the latest Gallup poll, Trump s approval rating is at a dismal 34 percent. If it gets much lower, he ll be in Nixon territory and Mr. Watergate, unlike Trump, started his presidency with strong approval ratings. By the end of his presidency, Nixon s approval rating had tumbled to 24 percent. Now, Nixon may not have had support from Nazis but he did have Roger Stone.Trump s approval ratings are worse than Bill Clinton s were at the height of the proceedings to impeach him because he was the recipient of an adulterous blow job.

The NAACP is glad to see Steve Bannon out of the White House,  Derrick Johnson, the group s interim president and CEO said in a statement. Ousting one key staffer, however, can t erase the words used by President Trump this week in defense of domestic terrorists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. President Trump provided permission for these hate groups to exist. Bannon left his job at the right-wing propoganda site, Breitbart News, to sign on as Trump s campaign manager and then became the alleged president s chief strategist following the election. As a well known racist and anti-Semite, Bannon was widely accepted as the bigoted mastermind behind much of Trump s most racist rhetoric and policies.In the statement, the NAACP also called on Trump to fire the rest of  the people who share Steve Bannon s poisonous beliefs, including senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security aide Sebastian Gorka.Bannon s firing came after racial tensions in the U.S. reached a fevered pitch following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that left a counter-protester dead. Trump has repeatedly failed to convincingly denounce these hate groups. Instead, he has chosen to argue that  both sides  were responsible for the violence and accused counter-protesters of violently attacking the poor innocent Nazis, which has lead to widespread outrage.The NAACP is absolutely right.

1,Fake,"August 18, 2017",News,"This year America has seen an interesting and terrifying new technique for dealing with protesters. Republicans, buoyed by their base s enthusiasm for physically harming people who inconvenience them, took a hard look at all of the things being protested across the country. They saw natives at Standing Rock, young African-Americans at Black Lives Matter rallies, and a pretty wide assortment at Donald Trump s inauguration, and they decided the best way to deal with it was to hit them with cars.That s not hyperbole. I guarantee you have had at least one argument on Facebook with a relative or old high school friend who sees pictures of protests and jokes about running over the people in the streets. The GOP decided to codify that behavior by writing laws that would reduce or remove penalties for drivers who do just that.Beginning with North Dakota, lawmakers in six states began to pen a series of proposals that all looked very similar to each other. House Bill 1203 would set the tone:Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a driver of a motor vehicle who unintentionally causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road, street, or highway, is not guilty of an offense.Similar laws cropped up in Florida, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas. These heartless laws were part of a larger effort by Republicans to stifle dissent on a larger scale; a proposal in Oregon would have required schools to expel protesters even peripherally involved in a riot, while one in Ferguson, Missouri   the heartland of the Black Lives Matter movement   would have created an offense called  unlawful traffic interference  with which protesters could be charged if they stood in the path of any important white people on their way to do important white people things.It took until the murder of Heather Heyer for Fox Nation to take down a video posted in humor on their website entitled Here s A Reel Of Cars Plowing Through Protesters Trying To Block The Road. I guess this like what a conscience looks like on Fox?But even after the events of this last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, those GOP legislators are still defending their bills. On Sunday, Texas Rep. Pat Fallon was wondering if  the far left  knew the difference between a street and a highway. He deleted his social media posts, but his proposal remains:A person operating a motor vehicle who injures another person with the motor vehicle is not liable for the injury if, at the time of the injury:(1) the person operating the motor vehicle was exercising due care; and (2)  the person injured was blocking traffic in a public right-of-way while participating in a protest or demonstration.Any wild guesses what it might take in Texas to prove you were  exercising due care  when you hit that troublesome agitator?Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"," Even After Charlottesville, If You Hit Protesters With A Car, Republicans Want To Protect You"

Further, two of Trump s most trusted confidantes, Ivanka and Jared, are huge supporters of traditional Democratic causes, such as LGBTQ rights, climate change action, and women s right to choose.So, we can expect a shift to the left if Trump listens to his daughter and son-in-law with Bannon gone, and therefore we can expect ripe fruit for infighting between right-wing media and the Trump White House. It really does seem as if the GOP made a Faustian deal with their proverbial devil, and they are losing. That s terrible for Trump but great for America.Pop your popcorn folks, and keep watching.

Speaking to the members of these white supremacist groups, Schwarzenegger said,  your heroes are losers. I knew the original Nazis, because you see, I was born in Austria in 1947, shortly after the second world war, Schwarzenegger says. I can tell you that these ghosts [hate groups] idolize spent the rest of their lives living in shame and right now, they re resting in hell,  he continues.Schwarzenegger then addressed Trump directly, telling him he has a  moral responsibility  to condemn these racist hate groups. He even offered to help Trump figure out just exactly what it is that he should say at a time like this. The world is watching. Now, let me help you write your speech a little bit,  Schwarzenegger says.  As President of the United States and as a Republican, I reject the support of white supremacists.

1,Fake,"August 18, 2017",News,"Almost three years ago, a history buff and biographer of Robert E. Lee, Jonathan Horn, wrote a book that provided a different perspective of the Confederate general. The book, titled The Man Who Would Not Be Washington, recalled a history of Lee that many casual readers don t know, and one that many fans like to whitewash. With all of Donald Trump s ridiculous comparisons between Lee and the father of our country, it s easy to overlook that the southern leader was the son of a man who d served Washington in the Revolutionary War like nearly no other.In fact, Lee s father,  Light Horse Harry,  gave the eulogy at George Washington s funeral:First in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen.In death, only the best things are remembered. There was no urban legend about Washington s  wooden teeth  while he was alive. He provided for the liberation of his own slaves in his will. His last words, after the valiant efforts of doctors to save him, were  Tis well.  Washington was a complex man, and his legacy would only unpack years after his passing.The same can be said of the eulogist s son. When the most famous Confederate looked at secession before the Civil War, he was disdainful:The framers of our Constitution never exhausted so much labour, wisdom and forbearance in its formation   if it was intended to be broken by every member of the Confederacy at will.Lee eventually resigned his commission in the Union Army. He joined his home state of Virginia in taking up arms in rebellion, and like many of the conservatives of today, he fudged on his history, insisting that he d always favored leaving the United States. But his complexity, unpacked after his death, is most compelling in looking at his view of remembrance.Robert E. Lee never wanted monuments or memorials to the Civil War.Some of the history of Lee s re-change of heart is well-known: Upon his surrender, he vowed to support the U.S. Constitution  henceforth,  and commanded his followers to do the same. But many wanted to honor Lee s service to the South with statues and memorials. Lee rebuffed them:As regards the erection of such a monument as is contemplated, my conviction is, that, however grateful it would be to the feelings of the South, the attempt, in the present condition of the country, would have the effect of retarding instead of accelerating its accomplishment, and of continuing if not adding to the difficulties under which the Southern people labor.Robert E. Lee understood then what many still do not get today: That the flags of wars past serve nothing but to fight those wars over again in our minds. He was adamant:I think it wiser moreover not to keep open the sores of war, but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavoured to obliterate the marks of civil strife and to commit to oblivion the feelings it engendered.Now, I personally am not a historian. But early America has always been a passion of mine   My great-great-great-great-great grandfather is buried in Calais, Vermont, his service in the Revolutionary War inscribed on his headstone. It should likewise at least serve as instruction for those who would fawn over its legends. Many symbols exist today commemorating the Confederacy, especially in Virginia, Lee s own state.But if you want to honor Robert E. Lee, honor the fact that he never wanted to see you waving a Confederate flag.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Even Robert E.

1,Fake,"August 18, 2017",News,"White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon has long been a controversial figure. Prior to joining Donald Trump s campaign, he was the head of Breitbart News, a racist website that Bannon said was the  platform for the alt-right.  The alt-right, is, of course, nothing more than a rebranded name for white supremacists. Ever since Trump made Bannon his Chief Strategist, there have been calls for his removal from the White House. Now, in the wake of Trump s disgraceful response to the violent and murderous gathering of white supremacists in Charlottesville, Virgnina, it is being reported that Bannon is finally being pushed out.Of course, Trump is a coward, though, so it will be public humiliation, like what was suffered by former Republican National Committee head turned White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, that will be the technique to get rid of Bannon. However, as is par for the course with this White House, Bannon aids and allies are saying that Bannon had already decided to leave Team Trump, and that it just hadn t been announced yet. From the New York Times:The president and senior White House officials were debating when and how to dismiss Mr. Bannon. The two administration officials cautioned that Mr. Trump is known to be averse to confrontation within his inner circle, and could decide to keep on Mr. Bannon for some time.As of Friday morning, the two men were still discussing Mr. Bannon s future, the officials said. A person close to Mr. Bannon insisted the parting of ways was his idea, and that he had submitted his resignation to the president on Aug. 7, to be announced at the start of this week, but it was delayed in the wake of the racial unrest in Charlottesville, Va.Methinks there s a lot of lying on both sides going on here. Trump has clearly been afraid of dismissing Bannon, for fear of the obvious ability of Bannon to turn all of the far-right media   and thus crucial parts of his base   against him, via the very influential far-right publications he holds such enormous sway over. On Bannon s part, he didn t want to go anywhere, because his stated goal has always been to, quote,  destroy the administrative state. Either way, it s a good thing that the head of the modern white supremacist movement will be reportedly leaving the White House. Now, we just have to get rid of the rest of the Nazis, and we ll really be in business.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images", REPORTS: Charlottesville Fallout Was The Final Nail In Bannon’s Coffin
1,Fake,"August 17, 2017",News,"While the President of the United States seems to be very, very confused about how racism, violence, and bigotry should be dealt with, many Americans are not. In response to the horrific white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, numerous politicians and companies have raised their voices and taken a stand against white supremacy in a way that Donald Trump has not. One of the best responses so far has come from online dating site OkCupid, who responded perfectly when it discovered that neo-Nazi Chris Cantwell was one of its members.Cantwell recently got his 15 minutes of fame when he was seen in a viral video crying about being arrested by police after the Charlottesville attack. Once OkCupid was alerted that Cantwell was a member on the dating website, the company worked quickly to show that white supremacist values would not be tolerated. In response,  white supremacist Chris Cantwell  has been banned from OkCupid   for life! This is the perfect response to a hateful imbecile who stated publicly in the viral video that neo-Nazis like himself were  not nonviolent  and we ll fucking kill these people if we have to.  OkCupid made an entirely appropriate move to not only protect its other members from dating a dangerously unstable psychopath like Cantwell, but to also show that these attitudes should not be tolerated in any degree.To add an extra sting to the end of Cantwell s dating life (especially after he looked so pathetic in that video), OkCupid followed up their banning announcement with this perfect tweet:Bravo. We certainly hope this will encourage more companies to handle intolerant individuals in the same way. When we can t count on our president to do what should be morally obvious, we must count on each other to uphold the true values of this country.Featured image is a screenshot", OkCupid Wins The Internet With PERFECT Response To The Charlottesville Neo-Nazi On Their Site (TWEETS)

Not only has his already historically low approval rating taken yet another plunge (even amongst his own fan base), but people are lining up to attack Trump personally.One of those people is Laurel Baker, the executive director of the Palm Beach Chamber Of Commerce, who has decided to hit Trump where it will hurt most   his wallet. Knowing damn well that Trump doesn t actually have a heart or conscience, Baker knows that Trump would at least be sensitive to his business going down in flames. To get his point across, Baker is urging charities to boycott Trump s Mar-a-Lago club and stop holding events there.Baker stated that this move against Trump was motivated by Trump s disgusting, disappointing response to the violence in Charlottesville. Baker told The Palm Beach Post, If you have a conscience, you re really condoning bad behavior by continuing to be there. Many say it s the dollars (raised at the events) that count. Yes. But the integrity of any or organization rests on their sound decisions and stewardship. Personally, I do not feel that supporting him, directly or indirectly, speaks well of any organization. People are listening. Already, Trump s beloved club has suffered the cancellation of events that were scheduled by both the American Cancer Society and the Cleveland Clinic. The American Cancer Society stated: Our values and commitment to diversity are critical as we work to address the impact of cancer in every community. It has become increasingly clear that the challenge to those values is outweighing other business considerations. Trump s horrific hatred and bigotry is not only ruining his presidency, it is ruining his entire brand. At the end of Trump s disastrous presidency, he might not actually have a business to run anymore if he keeps going this route. Americans have long complained about Trump s presidency being intertwined in his conflicts of interests, but there might be a way we can make it work in our favor. Boycotting Trump s business is one of the greatest ways Americans can protest against Trump, as it s one of the only things Trump actually cares about.Featured image via Ian MacNicol  / Getty Images"," Chamber Of Commerce Exec Makes Trump Pay For Charlottesville, Urges Charities To Boycott Mar-a-Lago"

Because what Felix Sater says could land Trump in the bunk right next to him.Sater worked with Trump on many of his shady business dealings, including selling real estate to the Russians, one property being involved in a money-laundering scheme.Mueller s investigation into Trump s financial dealings has apparently dug up some really juicy stuff that proves Trump is a criminal who should be behind bars instead of the Oval Office.Trump tipped off investigators by warning Mueller to stay away from his family s finances. And he tipped them off even further by admitting that he may have sold condos to Russians. I mean, it s possible there s a condo or something, so, you know, I sell a lot of condo units, and somebody from Russia buys a condo, who knows?  Trump said.Clearly, Trump has something to hide that he doesn t want federal investigators to see.During an interview with New York Magazine, Sater said that once he is done testifying and spilling his guts the media will have a lot to talk about. In about the next 30 to 35 days, I will be the most colorful character you have ever talked about,  Sater said.  Unfortunately, I can t talk about it now, before it happens. And believe me, it ain t anything as small as whether or not they re gonna call me to the Senate committee. And Sater also understands that what he has to say will probably send him to prison as well, which makes what he has to say all the more interesting because he is willing to go to jail in order to deliver damning testimony against Trump.According to Paul Wood of The Spectator, For several weeks there have been rumours that Sater is ready to rat again, agreeing to help Mueller.  He has told family and friends he knows he and POTUS are going to prison,  someone talking to Mueller s investigators informed me.The fact that Sater understands that what he says could put him in prison is significant. It means that he is willing to tell the truth about Trump even if it means losing his own freedom. Short of seeing Trump s tax returns, Sater may be the next best resource. If anybody knows the vile depths Trump has sunk to do business with the Russians, it s Sater.Trump has got to be panicking right now because it may not be long before he is arrested, prosecuted and locked away.If that happens, Trump would be the first president to be indicted and sentenced to jail. His disgracing of the office of the presidency would be complete and total.

Of course, Trump s attack was nothing but petty, making sure that Graham and America remember that Trump beat him in the 2015-2016 presidential primaries. Trump wrote: Publicity seeking Lindsey Graham falsely stated that I said there is moral equivalency between the KKK, neo-Nazis & white supremacists and people like Ms. Heyer. Such a disgusting lie.

Graham has been more critical than most Republicans when it comes to Trump s defense of racists and his neo-Nazi fan base. On Sunday, Graham trashed Trump on Fox News when he said: These groups seem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House. I don t know why they believe that, but they don t see me as a friend in the Senate, and I would urge the president to dissuade these groups that he s their friend.

Smith said on his show, Shepard Smith Reporting, that the network reached out in an effort to get a Republican on-air to defend the President s remarks, but failed to land a single one. Our booking team  and they re good  reached out to Republicans of all stripes across the country today,  Smith said.  Let s be honest, Republicans don t often really mind coming on Fox News Channel.

That is likely why there has been radio silence from his daughter Ivanka, who is a Jewish convert, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who is a genetic Jew. Trump s grandchildren are Jewish as well, of course. However, that did not stop him from defending the white nationalists, neo-Nazis, Hitler sympathizers, and other assorted racists who marched with torches through the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia shouting racist and anti-Semitic slogans.Therefore, it should come as no surprise that the Rabbi who helped Ivanka convert to Judaism is not impressed. In fact, he seems to be quite outraged. Rabbi Emeritus Haskel Lookstein is beside himself with rage at Trump s response to the Charlottesville tragedy, and rightly so. He wrote a letter condemning Trump s remarks, saying: We are appalled by this resurgence of bigotry and antisemitism, and the renewed vigor of the neo-Nazis, KKK, and alt-right. While we avoid politics, we are deeply troubled by the moral equivalency and equivocation President Trump has offered in his response to this act of violence. Rabbi Lookstein released the letter publicly, and likely will be attacked by Trump. The divider-in-chief may have done the unthinkable with this one and divided his own family. Ivanka and Jared take their faith very seriously, and Ivanka has been a devout Jew since 2010 and is raising her children in a seriously observant Jewish home. They likely already have a hard time working in Trump s White House, which is chock full of open racists, neo-Nazis, and anti-Semites. Jared has family members who died in the Nazi Holocaust. There is simply NO WAY, he is happy with Trump s equating white supremacists with those fighting against that kind of hate.This is especially evident considering the fact that Ivanka immediately denounced the hate and called the groups perpetuating it out by name in ways her father has repeatedly refused to do.Ivanka and Jared, do you really want your Jewish children growing up in this environment?

That s what concerns law enforcement the most right now. This is especially concerning, considering that the Department of Justice is explicitly focusing not on homegrown white supremacists, according to Vice News, but on ISIS-like groups instead. In fact, the Trump Department of Justice is not concerned with white supremacists at all. Cohn goes on to say: As it relates to preventing mass-casualty attacks, we know what we need to do. This guy in Charlottesville [James Alex Fields Jr.] fits the behavior profile. His family had called the police before. Of course, James Alex Fields Jr. is the young neo-Nazi who rammed a car into a crowd of protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and wounding many others. He was known to idolize Adolf Hitler and was pretty much an out-front Nazi.The racist Trump Administration is literally endangering lives. This refusal to go after white supremacists, and indeed their open support of them, is beyond dangerous. It also means local law enforcement is on their own when dealing with this escalating threat because there will be no help to be had from the federal government.

1,Fake,"August 16, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s weak response to the racially motivated, white supremacist terrorist attack in Charlottesville, Virginia has been a sombering moment for America. While many Americans did not have any high hopes for Trump as POTUS, some at least thought he would be decent enough to condemn violence and bigotry, or at least not publicly defend racism. Unfortunately, we have been severely disappointed.Trump has failed so miserably to denounce hate that even several Republicans are disgusted by the lazy tweeter in chief. And while many of them are speaking up, most of them don t have the guts to call Trump directly out or make any sort of passionate statement on the matter. However, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is beyond done with Trump. In response to Trump s continued failure to respond appropriately to the Charlottesville crisis, Graham has issued a blistering statement calling Trump out by name and accurately accusing the disgraced president of dividing America.Here s Graham s statement, which we hope will inspire many more conservatives to openly criticize our modern-day Hitler:In his statement, Graham also brilliantly pointed out that Trump is basically welcoming neo-Nazis and KKK members with open arms by making comments that defend racists.Graham s statement was much needed, as much of the Republican Party has not stood up to Trump s inaction in a strong enough way. An innocent life was lost in Charlottesville, and Trump has defended the people who were responsible. That should make GOPers across the country ashamed of even being associated with Trump.Condemning racism and white supremacy should be a no-brainer. It is extremely odd that the Republican Party s leader   and many other conservatives   are having a hard time calling this out and taking the strong stance that Graham has.

In an op-ed on his website, Reich explained his stance further.Trump s goal has never been to promote guns or white supremacy or to fuel attacks on the press and the left. These may be means, but the goal has been to build and fortify his power. And keep him in power even if it s found that he colluded with Russia to get power.Trump and his consigliere Steve Bannon have been quietly encouraging a civil war between Trump s base of support   mostly white and worried   and everyone who s not.It s built on economic stresses and racial resentments. It s fueled by paranoia. And it s conveyed by Trump s winks and nods haters, and his deafening silence in the face of their violence.Reich then explained that there is another civil war currently raging within the White House  where Bannon and his prot g s are doing battle with leveler heads. Let s hope the leveler heads win the civil war in the White House. Let s pray the leveler heads in our society prevent the civil war Trump and Bannon want to instigate in America,  he concludes.Reich s article condemned Trump for failing to denounce the white supremacist ideologies that were responsible for the death of Heather Heyer, who was killed in Charlottesville, Virginia over the weekend when a Nazi plowed his car through a group of counter protesters. Since then, Trump has claimed that  many sides  are to blame, but as Reich explains, this is all just part of his plot to kick off another civil war.

1,Fake,"August 16, 2017",News,"While Donald Trump, a man who speaks in hyperbole and absolutes like  bad  and  sad,  is finding it difficult to condemn violent racists, the great-great grandson of Robert E. Lee, the Civil War general whose statue spurred the protest, spoke out against the hatred and said that the statues should be taken down.The violence in Charlotte, Virginia erupted over the weekend during a planned white supremacist protest over the fact the city s plans to remove the statue after the city council voted, saying that the monuments to the Civil War are,  painful reminders of the violence and injustice of slavery and other harms of white supremacy that are best removed from public spaces. There s no place for that,  Robert E. Lee V tells Newsweek, referring to the white supremacist protesters who carried torches and marched through Charlottesville on Friday.  There s no place for that hate. While he didn t mention Trump by name, the younger Lee said that even his great-great grandfather would have done a better job denouncing the Neo-nazis and white supremacists. We don t believe in that whatsoever,  Lee says. He is quick to defend his ancestor s name:  Our belief is that General Lee would not tolerate that sort of behavior either. His first thing to do after the Civil War was to bring the Union back together, so we could become a more unified country. We don t want people to think that they can hide behind Robert E. Lee s name and his life for these senseless acts of violence that occurred on Saturday,  Lee says.As for whether the statues should remain, Lee says yes, but in proper context. I think that is absolutely an option, to move it to a museum and put it in the proper historical context,  Lee says.  Times were very different then. We look at the institution of slavery, and it s absolutely horrendous. Back then, times were just extremely different. We understand that it s complicated in 2017, when you look back at that period of time  If you want to put statues of General Lee or other Confederate people in museums, that makes good sense. In other words, much like Holocaust memorials, memorials to the most divisive, cruel and violent time in American History should be educational and cautionary, not something to be worshiped.It s pretty clear that Lee is right about what his ancestor and namesake would have thought. It s well documented that even the original Robert E. Lee didn t want the Civil War memorialized. He wanted the nation to heal. I think it wiser,  the retired military leader wrote about a proposed Gettysburg memorial in 1869,  not to keep open the sores of war but to follow the examples of those nations who endeavored to obliterate the marks of civil strife, to commit to oblivion the feelings engendered.

According to White House officials, Trump is coming apart at the seams over this, as Robert Costa reported: Person close to Kelly framed it to me this way: POTUS fuming at press, coverage of C ville handling.

Seriously, what did Trump expect to happen after he ignored America s pleas to denounce the violence for two whole days, before issuing a scripted, half-ass statement on Monday? Not even the white supremacists Trump targeted in his response believed that he was actually denouncing racism.If Trump wanted positive press coverage, he should have actually done his job and condemned the white supremacist values and bigotry from the start. Speaking up against racism and the violence that broke out of that white nationalist rally was possibly the easiest task a President could ask for, and Trump failed miserably at executing that. Instead, Trump protected and defended the racist attackers, making his approval rating only plummet further and giving the media even more things to criticize.Trump can blame the media all he wants, but it is his own lack of competency that is responsible for his failure as president.

1,Fake,"August 14, 2017",News,"It s a bad day for Donald Trump when even the most conservative, racist media networks are calling him out for his failure to denounce the white supremacists responsible for the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.On Monday, Fox host Eboni Williams went on Fox News Specialists and ripped Trump a new one for his disappointing, weak response to the Charlottesville tragedy. While many conservatives have stated that Trump s first pathetic response on Saturday was more than enough, many have gone after Trump and called for him to publicly denounce white supremacy in a follow-up statement. Williams said: Mr. President, your initial remarks were cowardly and dangerous, and they indeed warranted a second statement. Williams  attack on Trump got even more bold when she bashed his  Make America Great Again  slogan, stating that people have been confused about the inclusiveness of Trump s message. Williams said that she will no longer give Trump  the benefit of the doubt  when it comes to Trump excluding other races. I was legitimately unsure, but absent more conclusive evidence, I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. I can no longer do that, Mr. President. No more benefit, all doubt. Williams also called Trump out for his statement in which he  very intentionally chose to be ambiguous and to equivocate : President Trump, I do not know your heart. But what I do know for sure is that you ve clearly done the math, and you ve decided that your portion of the base that is absolutely racist is so significant, so valuable that you hesitate, even in the face of blatant, flagrant hatred to risk turning them off and thereby crippling your political stronghold. While you personally might not be a racist, President Trump, what you are is all too happy to reap the benefits of their support. Williams warned Trump that  this moment is on you , making sure that Trump knew he missed a major opportunity to prove his critics wrong. Instead, he only solidified everyone s belief that he s a racist piece of sh*t.

1,Fake,"August 14, 2017",News,"Donald Trump is in big trouble. Not only has his popularity been historically low, but his pathetic response to the recent tragedy in Charlottesville, Virginia has made him more hated than ever.It took Trump two full days to call out white supremacy and neo-Nazis as being responsible for the horrific  Unite the Right  rally and riot in Charlottesville   and now that he has, Trump is in yet another predicament. Solidifying the fact that Trump can t win no matter what he does, Trump is now in trouble with the few people who still support him   America s most racist alt-right.While Republicans have been abandoning Trump left and right, his most loyal supporters have been clinging on   until now. After Trump called out white supremacists on Monday, former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke denounced Trump and bashed him for criticizing racists and the KKK.Duke went on Twitter to shred Trump for giving in to the  fake news  media and holding racists responsible for the violence that occurred at the rally. Duke must have felt quite betrayed and pissed off by Trump, because then he went over to Periscope to continue bashing Trump, calling the POTUS  statement  just ridiculous  and claiming that white nationalists aren t violent. He begged Trump to stop targeting white supremacists: President Trump, please, for God s sake, don t feel like you need to say these things. It s not going to do you any good. This temper tantrum follows Duke s post on Saturday, in reaction to Trump s weak statement on Charlottesville. Duke warned Trump to remember that he should be thanking his racist fanbase in a chilling tweet:Now that Trump has finally taken a half-ass stance against white supremacy, we can only expect that his fanbase is going to be almost nonexistent in the near future.Featured image via screenshot and Scott Olson / Getty Images", Trump Crushed As Ex-KKK Leader Bashes Him For Finally Calling Out White Supremacy In Charlottesville (VIDEO)
1,Fake,"August 14, 2017",News,"CNN s Jim Acosta is not especially well-liked by the White House. He tells it like it is in harsh, blunt terms, and of course, they don t like that. The growing feud continued today when Trump gave a supposed press conference after a full weekend of promising a big press conference. But at a true press conference, reporters are able to ask questions. Donald Trump wouldn t allow questions at this  press conference.  Acosta wanted to ask him about his responses to Charlottesville, because Trump s initial response to it was weak and pathetic, and one in which he wouldn t condemn the Nazis and other white supremacists, and puffed himself up rather than saying something heartfelt and inspirational like a real president would have.Getting no answer to that, Acosta asked him about the lack of a proper presser. Trump said that they d just had one. Apparently, in Trumpland, an egotistical speech that barely touches on anything and doesn t allow for questions from reporters qualifies as a press conference simply because the press is there. Trump s reply to Acosta? It doesn t bother me at all, but I like real news, not fake news. You re fake news. It s absolutely amazing that Trump calls anyone  fake news  when he s essentially the liar of liars who s spread more than his fair share of fake news. Acosta knows this, and threw a question at Trump that we ve all wanted to hear in response to the latest  fake news  accusation. Watch below:CNN s @Acosta to Trump: Can we ask you more questions?

1,Fake,"August 14, 2017",News,"It s official. Right-wing extremists have declared war on America.Rather than attend the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia with his fellow  Three Percenters  over the weekend, Jerry Drake Varnell decided to attempt a second Oklahoma City Bombing instead.Emulating right-wing terrorist Timothy McVeigh, Varnell wanted to detonate a car bomb near the memorial honoring the 168 people who were murdered in 1995 when McVeigh detonated a similar bomb outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, a blast that even killed many children.Luckily, Varnell was being monitored by the FBI at the time and even had an undercover agent with Varnell to guarantee that the bombing plot would fail. There was never a concern that our community s safety or security was at risk during this investigation,  FBI Special Agent Kathryn Peterson said in a statement.  I can assure the public, without hesitation, that we had Varnell s actions monitored every step of the way. Varnell was arrested while trying to detonate the unarmed bomb next to the BancFirst in Oklahoma City. He intended to post an anti-government manifesto on social media afterward if he had succeeded.And it appears that Varnell is connected to a group of right-wing extremists who are currently participating in the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that resulted in acts of violence and the murder of a woman in an act of domestic terrorism.The Washington Post reports:According to the complaint, over the course of a months-long undercover investigation by the FBI, Varnell made repeated statements about the extent of his hatred of the federal government.In one conversation he said he believed in the  Three Percenter  ideology   a form of anti-government activism that pledges resistance against the United States government on the belief it has infringed on the Constitution, according to court papers. Those who subscribe to the ideology incorrectly believe that only 3 percent of the colonial population participated in the American Revolution, and they see themselves as their heirs.Donald Trump s refusal to condemn Nazis and the rest of the right-wing extremists in Charlottesville has emboldened them. If the FBI had not already been monitoring Varnell, his bomb would have exploded and killed Americans. One wonders how many more domestic terrorism plots are underway because white nationalists think Trump is on their side.Featured image via Brittanica", Right-Wing Extremist Tries To Repeat Oklahoma City Bombing As Nazis Terrorize Charlottesville
1,Fake,"August 14, 2017",News,"There are a lot of polls out there, a lot of research, and it s hard to discern what s real from the signal-to-noise ratio. That s why, as a general rule, I prefer to read studies, polls, academic papers   the things meant to educate me   from people who aren t getting paid to produce them. Not that a paycheck is bad, mind you. It just creates a motive for a certain outcome that usually aligns with the checkbook holder s opinion. The Public Religion Research Institute (PRRI) is a non-profit whose focus I suppose you can probably guess.The newest paper from PRRI comes on the heels of Trump s directive to the DOJ to begin investigating universities for discriminating against white people. Like all Republicans, Trump believes that Affirmative Action, by leveling the playing field, actually tilts it in favor of people of color.That s asinine, but I guarantee that you   whoever you are, reading this  you know someone who thinks the same thing.In fact, that was the focus of PRRI s latest research. This graph shows responses from different demographics to queries on just who, exactly, is discriminated against in America.There are some interesting takeaways here: First, of course, is that Democrats are likeliest to see discrimination where it demonstrably exists. To be a partisan at least requires one to be versed in the aims of the party they favor, and Democrats aim to reduce discrimination. But even more fascinating to me are the averages, over in the  All Americans  section of the graph. This reflected the opinions of both partisan groups and those who identified as neither, combined.The fact that any respondents indicated they thought there even was discrimination against whites is hilarious to me. I personally think they re confusing  you didn t get that job  with  you kinda felt uncomfortable on the subway the other night,  but I don t really have science on my side with that informal study. But Christians? Are you kidding me? You don t even have to be a member to get their holidays off work! That kind of response makes Republicans even more heartbreakingly stupid than I thought.In literally every case, the group of Democratic respondents is closer to the views of All Americans than the group of Republicans. All of them. Look back at the graph and do the addition or subtraction. In every case, Republicans were less likely to see discrimination where it does exist and more likely to see it where it does not.Me, looking for an image for this article.

On Monday, a spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel showed Trump how he should have responded.According to Merkel spokesman Steffen Seibert, the German chancellor was shocked by the deadly white supremacist marches that took place in Virginia over the weekend and described the events as  evil  and  disgusting. The scenes at the right-wing extremist march were absolutely repulsive   naked racism, anti-Semitism and hate in their most evil form were on display,  Siebert said. Such images and chants are disgusting wherever they may be and they are diametrically opposed to the political goals of the chancellor and the entire German government,  he added.White supremacists descended on Charlottesville Friday night to protest the removal of a Confederate statue. They carried tiki torches and chanted  we will not be replaced  while giving Nazi salutes. On Saturday, one of the white supremacists who had attended the rally drove his car through a crowd of counter-protesters, leaving one woman dead and 19 others injured.Of course, Trump can t denounce this type of bullsh*t because these are the same people who voted him into the White House. It s a damn shame that he can t disavow Nazis but we really shouldn t be surprised. This is the same man who couldn t denounce David Duke.

Vice-Mayor Wes Bellamy stated that his community has come together in solidarity to fight against the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who were responsible for riots that resulted in the death of a counter-protester. And while Trump has continued to pretend he has no connection or responsibility for the riots, Bellamy directly called him out and held him accountable.In the interview, Bellamy stated that if white supremacists under the guidance of their president, number 45  returned to Charlottesville, the community wouldn t hesitate to drive them back out. He said: They can continue to come, but our community will not break. The people here of Charlottesville, white people, black people, yellow people, old people, young people, we re a community that rallies around together. This is a community that I saw pick me up on my darkest and deepest moments to encourage me   and they ve done the same for other people. We re a resilient group. Bellamy then spoke directly to Trump, pointing out that he has the responsibility to condemn white supremacists, which he still has not yet done. Bellamy said: So 45, we re looking for your leadership. Condemn that white supremacist attacks. Condemn these domestic terrorists. Tell them to leave. You re their leader. Stand up.

In short, white nationalists believe that Trump s non-condemnation means that he stands with them.And that s a serious threat to the safety of every citizen in this nation.White nationalists now believe they can do whatever they want and that they have Trump s approval.This is why Donald Trump must condemn white nationalists. But even if he did so now, it s too little, too late.The vile racists and Nazis who comprise the Alt-Right movement will simply ignore it and insist that Trump s true feelings about their group were already stated in his initial reaction.So, Trump may have just made the most dangerous blunder of his presidency.

1,Fake,"August 13, 2017",News,"According to a new report Saturday from Axios, a source very close to Donald Trump has indicated that Trump believes his chief strategist Steve Bannon is to blame for leaks coming out of the White House regarding other members of Trump s staff. It would be easy to say at this point that Bannon s position at Trump s right hand is in jeopardy, but the fact that Trump is simply talking about it instead of firing him already may indicate otherwise.This could be an elaborate test to see if the news that Trump suspects Bannon makes it out of the White House, which of course it has   meaning whoever the president told about his suspicions is, if not the leaker, at least also a leaker. Or it could be that Bannon is innocent, and the Axios source is the leaker, trying to throw everyone off the trail. Most likely, however, is that Donald Trump is a loose-lipped dipshit who doesn t care who his audience is, he just wants to look like he knows what he s doing. Even having a suspicion means he s thinking about it, right?Bannon has not commented on the news, nor is he likely to. The notorious white supremacist has more to worry about right now with his movement than whether or not he keeps his job at the White House. After Saturday s vehicular murder of one protester and grievous injury to 3 dozen others following Friday s torchlight rally of the alt-Right and KKK, more attention will surely be paid to nationalist hate groups across the country, regardless of what Trump or Bannon wants.The odds of Trump finally getting rid of the Breitbart impresario of intolerance are much higher now that his new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly, has already set a precedent with the firing of Anthony Scaramucci.Then again, it could be that Bannon knows where all the bodies are buried, so to speak, and Trump can t risk getting rid of him whether he trusts him or not. All I know is, both Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are unhappy, and that makes me smile.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Trump Suspects Bannon Is The White House Leaker.

1,Fake,"August 12, 2017",News,"Donald Trump ran an openly white supremacist campaign during his travesty of a run for the presidency. Now that he is in the White House, this has continued. He has literal white supremacists working in the White House in the form of Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon, Senior Adviser Sebastian Gorka, and speechwriter and immigration policy maker Stephen Miller.With Trump s election, white supremacists across the nation have been emboldened. Prior to his inauguration, white supremacist Trump supporters held a gathering celebrating Trump s victory in the Reagan Building in Washington, in which people could be seen giving Nazi salutes, and in which the leader of the gathering, Richard Spencer, shouted  HEIL TRUMP!  Trump denounced these happenings in tepid terms, and only under intense public pressure. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that he has not acknowledged that the reason that 35 people have been injured and one person is dead in Charlottesville, Virginia due to violence at a white nationalist rally is, well, the work and fault of hateful white supremacists. However, there is condemnation coming from a rather surprising source: GOP Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL).During the GOP primary, Rubio was sharply critical of Trump. He called Trump a  con artist,  and  erratic.  Nonetheless, once Trump clinched the nomination, Rubio dropped the criticism and lined up dutifully behind the man he knew was an unfit bigot and helped get him elected. Now, however, it seems Trump has gone too far in his refusal to acknowledge the rise in white supremacy in the Trump era. Rubio tweeted:Very important for the nation to hear @potus describe events in #Charlottesville for what they are, a terror attack by #whitesupremacists  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 12, 2017Rubio also roundly denounced the white supremacists themselves:Nothing patriotic about #Nazis,the #KKK or #WhiteSupremacists It's the direct opposite of what #America seeks to be. #Charlotesville  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 12, 2017These haters in #Charlotesville are agitators in search of relevance & publicity for a vile cause very few people support 1/2  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 12, 2017Can't ignore them,but also don't give them relevance they crave.Only way they win is if they can turn the rest of us against each other 2/2  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) August 12, 2017I never thought I d agree with Marco Rubio on anything in a million years, but I do. Donald Trump has mainstreamed bigotry the likes of which America has not seen in public in this violent of a manner since the Civil Rights Movement, and he is refusing to own it. Then again, narcissists never own their own wrongdoing, so no surprise there.If the GOP wants to tamp down on this nonsense, they need to call out Trump, and kick the racists out of their party. That starts with the band of white supremacists currently squatting in the White House. In fact, it starts with the man-baby bigot  president  himself. Kick them out.

1,Fake,"August 11, 2017",News,"Before dawn on Wednesday, the feds raided the home of former Donald Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort. Trump, as intelligence expert Malcolm Nance says, is getting buggy. The investigation is getting closer and closer to him, and his poll numbers are in a free-fall, so from the safety of 17 day golf vacation in New Jersey, Trump is threatening war against not one, not two, but three countries.Most of the media has been covering his exchange of provocative nuclear threats with North Korean Dictator Kim Jong Un. If that s not terrifying enough, Trump also hinted that he s planning to attack Iran because, well, they may or may not be abiding by the nuclear deal. All indications are that they are, but that doesn t stop a commander-in-chief who desperately, so desperately, needs a way to wag the dog.On Friday, Trump announced that there might be a third war on the table. This one against Venezuela. We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,  Trump told reporters at his New Jersey golf club on Friday.The president did not answer a question about whether American troops would lead a potential operation. We don t talk about it. But a military operation, a military option, is certainly something we could pursue,  he responded.Source: CNBCTo be fair, Venezuela isn t exactly our friend. Two years ago, President Obama issued sanctions against the oil-rich country, in part over its human rights abuses.The White House said the order targeted people whose actions undermined democratic processes or institutions, had committed acts of violence or abuse of human rights, were involved in prohibiting or penalizing freedom of expression, or were government officials involved in public corruption. Venezuelan officials past and present who violate the human rights of Venezuelan citizens and engage in acts of public corruption will not be welcome here, and we now have the tools to block their assets and their use of U.S. financial systems,  White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in a statement. We are deeply concerned by the Venezuelan government s efforts to escalate intimidation of its political opponents,  he added.Source: ReutersTrump, whose only political tactic is to try to intimidate his political opponents, also complained about the human rights abuses, despite having no problems with the human rights abuses of Saudi Arabia, Russia and the Philippines.One fact, and only one fact, might indicate that Trump is just bluster. Trump s cozy relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin might actually be keeping us safer, at least as far as the idea of Trump waging war against Venezuela or North Korea. Venezuela is a strong trading partner of Russia. Putin also backs North Korea, as does our largest trading partner, China.This whole show could be just Trump trying to boost his poll numbers, or it could be his way of pretending to create distance between him and Putin, but regardless, the talk is reckless and potentially deadly. The people he s threatening don t see his talk as political posturing. They are taking it very seriously and even if Trump doesn t pull the trigger first, they certainly could.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", Trump Is Now Talking About Going To War With Three Countries
1,Fake,"August 11, 2017",News,"Donald Trump has now taken his threats to North Korea off Twitter and is making them to the public. Quite frankly, the situation is getting more terrifying as the days go on.After tweeting this morning that U.S. military solutions were  locked and loaded,  Trump made some very disturbing comments when speaking to reporters this afternoon at his New Jersey golf course, where he is enjoying a 17-day vacation.When a reporter asked Trump about his ominous tweet, Trump stated that he meant exactly what he said and that his words are very, very easy to understand.  Trump also said that the Trump administration would be  very, very successful  in acting swiftly on North Korea, right before directly attacking North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. Trump said: And if he utters one threat in the form of an overt threat, which, by the way, he has been uttering for years, and his family has been uttering for years, or if he does anything with respect to Guam or any place else that s an American territory or an American ally, he will truly regret it, and he will regret it fast. This all began when Trump threatened North Korea with  fire and fury  on Tuesday, and now we re here. Trump is leading America down a dangerous road, and he barely understands the consequences that will follow. He carelessly speaks through his insecurities and fragile ego and shows no concern for how irresponsible his comments actually are. Trump is more concerned with looking like a tough leader (and like a dictator) than he is with improving the country and keeping peaceful working relations with the rest of the world. If this is the kind of disaster we are looking at just a few months into Trump s presidency, the world will be in shambles if he lasts four years.You can watch this disturbing Trump footage below:Featured image via Drew Angerer /Getty Images"," Trump Goes Mental On Threats To North Korea, This Is His Most Dangerous One Yet (VIDEO)"
1,Fake,"August 11, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s conflicts of interest were of massive concern for many Americans, and rightfully so. There is absolutely no doubt that Trump has been trying to profit off of his presidency   and now there s proof.This year, Trump s company turned $1.97 million in profit at Trump International Hotel, which is far higher than expectations. The Trump Organization actually predicted it would lose $2.1 million in the first four months of Trump s presidency, but the business is instead boasting a 192 percent improvement over what the Trump family projected when the hotel was opened in the fall.At the center of these profits are members of Trump s own Cabinet, who have either stayed or lived at the hotel. The hotel is also frequently visited by Trump s inner circle and Republican leaders, who are willing to spend big money and food and beverages at the hotel s bar and restaurant. Currently, the hotel is charging guests an average of $652.98 a night, which is 57 percent higher than the company s expectations. This makes the hotel the most expensive in the city   many others such as Four Seasons and Willard are only charging $495 per night.It s no wonder that several ethics experts and Democrats have objected to this arrangement. Rep. Peter A. DeFazio (D-Ore.) called the government s lease a  highly unethical arrangement.  He said: What makes all of this particularly galling is that we now have the unprecedented situation where the President of the United States is both the landlord and tenant of a federal building. Trump has made absolutely no effort to address ethical concerns about his businesses, even though he had originally promised to do so when he won the election.Trump continues to be involved in his businesses and continues to profit off of them. Already, he has been sued by government watchdog groups and state attorneys general over these business practices. However, his behavior clearly shows that he doesn t care. Trump has only been in office for a few months, and he s already spent 65 days at his properties and continues to host dinners that look more like promotions than anything else.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 11, 2017The rhetorical march towards what could end up being a real nuclear war wrecked havoc on global markets, including Wall Street, as stocks plunged. In all, the economic loss added up to $1 trillion, the effects of which will likely hit households in America and around the world hard.According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch,With the tense mood pushing European shares down for a third day and Wall Street set to fall again, global stocks were on course for their worst week since Donald Trump won November s U.S. presidential election. We do just not know what happens next with the North Korea situation,  said BNY Mellon FX strategist Neil Mellor. For quite some time the market hasn t really reacted to things on the Korean Peninsula because we know from the past it is largely North Korean saber-rattling, and it may yet be. But with the rhetoric having gone to a different level, the market just can t afford to take that risk. Many world stock markets have hit record or multi-year highs in recent weeks, leaving them vulnerable to a sell-off, and the tensions over North Korea have proved the trigger.Indeed, Asia Pacific shares just suffered their biggest one-day loss since December. South Korea s KOSPI dropped by nearly a full two percent.In addition,  Australian shares were down 1.3 percent, set for a weekly loss of 0.6 percent and Chinese and Hong Kong bluechips lost 1.6 percent and 1.9 percent respectively. What has changed this time is that the scary threats and war of words between the U.S. and North Korea have intensified to the point that markets can t ignore it,  said Shane Oliver, head of investment strategy at AMP Capital in Sydney, reports the Post-Dispatch.The Dow Jones has also been falling since Tuesday, the same day Trump threatened North Korea with  fire and fury.  As of Friday, the Dow has shed 300 points.Trump often brags about the stock market even though the record growth began under President Obama. Donald Trump has not enacted a single economic policy since taking office. The stock market had continued setting records thanks to President Obama s handling of the economy and steady leadership. Trump was merely taking credit for Obama s achievement.But now the stock market is falling in America and around the world because of Trump s war rhetoric, which means this trillion dollar loss is all his fault. There is no blaming President Obama for this economic slide. Trump owns this. And more rhetoric or an attack on North Korea will just make things worse.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Trump’s Rhetoric Just Resulted In A Trillion Dollar Economic Loss Worldwide

1,Fake,"August 10, 2017",News,"It seems like a lifetime since March 23rd, 2010. But thanks to a pretty significant bill signed that day, at least there are no lifetime caps on your health insurance anymore. In fact, there were so many rules and regulations inside Obamacare that benefited consumers instead of insurers that the GOP went absolutely insane trying to undo them. That s no small wonder: Insurance companies gave Republican candidates and conservative groups nearly 37 million dollars in the last election cycle of 2015-16 alone.But the one thing Obamacare didn t do  couldn t do   was clamp down on premiums. Not without changing the way the entire industry is regulated. The fact is, premiums have been skyrocketing for a long time, and for a simple reason. Insurance companies know you need them more than they need you. In other words, because they can. But an interesting thing happened after the ACA was signed: The rising cost of premiums slowed to less than half the growth rate they were undergoing during the Bush years. Why? Because more people were getting insured.Republicans point to raw numbers and call it an increase that happened under Obama. But the premium increase from 2010 to 2016 was much, much smaller than it would have been without the changes to the system that Obamacare wrought. What will they point to now that premiums are on a fast track again? They won t point to Republican policy or Donald Trump. But I will.The Kaiser Family Foundation, a non-partisan, non-profit health care think tank, has been studying premium growth for nearly 20 years. In fact, if you ve ever read stats on health care   who s insured, median cost, what might happen if various bills were passed   you were likely looking at KFF data. And according to their latest study, there s a definitive reason that premiums are going up at the rate they re back to: Because Donald Trump is sabotaging the ACA.Trump s constant description of Obamacare as  failing  is already unhelpful. But his threats to stop cost-sharing subsidy payments are worse. And even worse than that, his persistent badgering of the GOP Congress to repeal Obamacare entirely   even without a replacement plan   has insurance companies scrambling to figure out how to stay in business. If Donald Trump got his way, after all, the number of people without health insurance in America would double in a very short time. And if you don t have insurance, they don t have a customer.So what s the effect of Trump s sabotage? Premiums are about to go through the roof. Just by threatening to stop enforcing the individual mandate   the mechanism that makes Obamacare even work   Trump has caused insurers to request rate increases from regulators anywhere from 1.2 percent to 20 percent. And his threats to stop cost-sharing payments bumps that startling figure up to 23 percent.For years, Republicans liked to point to any increase in premiums as the fault of Obamacare. But premium growth slowed as America got used to the idea of a larger risk pool, and it hasn t started under Obama in the first place. Now we can point directly to the actions of Donald Trump as the reason premiums are once again on the rise.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images"," Trump Is Raising Your Healthcare Premiums, And That’s A Fact"

Unfortunately, as Special Investigator Robert Mueller is likely to prove soon, Trump is the emperor with no clothes. He wields almost no power, even as president. He is 100 percent on the pocket of Russian President Vladimir Putin and if you aren t convinced yet, this should do it for you.Putin is punishing the United States for the sanctions against him by cutting 755 embassy workers. Instead of retaliating (as he would with pretty much anyone from Rosie O Donnell to Kim Jong Un), Trump instead thanked Putin.A week ago, Congress voted nearly unanimously to send Russia a message by passing a bill enacting strict sanctions against them. The sanctions are about the country s interference in our 2016 election and for its brutal aggression against the Ukraine and Syria and they hit Putin where it hurts.The Russian sanctions will target people and entities that:   undermine US cybersecurity on behalf of the Russia government   invest certain amounts in Russia s energy export pipelines   conduct  significant  transactions with Russian defense and intelligence agencies (though this will come into effect six months from now)   commit, or assist in, serious human rights abuses   commit acts of  significant  corruption   provide support to the Syrian government to acquire arms   invest, or facilitate the investment of, $10 million or more in the Russian government s privatization of any state-owned asset in a one-year period that could unfairly benefit government officials or their associates.Source: CNNIn other words, the sanctions directly target the people who are holding and even laundering Putin s money.Sanctions were also handed to North Korea and Iran.Russia s hands are somewhat publicly tied, but after expelling 755 diplomats, Trump s reaction was beyond strange. He looked up mid-felatio and thanked the dictator. I want to thank him because we re trying to cut down our payroll   I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll,  Trump told reporters Thursday at his New Jersey golf club.Source: CNBCEven that is a lie.

Source: The HillI guess Moore, who s currently in the lead to be the nation s next Senator, doesn t know that Russia has one of the highest rates of abortion in the world. Republicans really have to do a better job of picking their dictator crushes.You may remember Moore as the Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice and religious nut job who was forced to leave office after refusing to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments as was ordered by a federal court.He took the job back in 2013, but was forced to resign once again for ethics violations, including his refusal to allow gay marriages once the Supreme Court ruled them constitutional.Moore loves him some Donald Trump, though. In two sentences he invoked  God  in reference to Trump, a man who s almost certainly never read the Bible, a whopping four times. God puts people in positions in positions he wants.   I believe he sent Donald Trump in there to do what Donald Trump can do,  Moore said.  More than thinking I can win, it s up to God and God s will. We will see what God would have me do. And here we thought it was bad enough with Jeff Sessions in the Senate. Actually, it was. Now, we ll have Sessions as AG and who knows what kind of nuttery replacing him in the Senate.

1,Fake,"August 10, 2017",News,"Donald Trump just LOVES attacking members of his own party. Seemingly not understanding that the 535 people in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate are a co-equal branch of government and can totally kneecap him and even remove him from office if they so choose, Trump has been steadily attacking a GOP stalwart: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.First, Trump decided that McConnell needed to  get back to work  on his failed healthcare legislation. Then, he suggested that McConnell should resign if he cannot get Trump s legislative agenda through the Senate. Well, it seems that other GOP Senators are sick and tired of Trump s bullying of their Senate leader, and are coming after him.First, Orrin Hatch, who is easily the oldest member of the Senate at age 83, had his office release the following cryptic message regarding Trump s attacks on McConnell:""@SenateMajLdr has been the best leader we ve had in my time in the Senate, through very tough challenges. I fully support him."" -Hatch pic.twitter.com/3vD5nFgE36  Senator Hatch Office (@senorrinhatch) August 10, 2017Of course, Trump is not one of them. He ran an insurgent campaign and took over their entire party, as they watched helplessly. Now, slowly but surely, the establishment elected Republicans are realizing that this deal with the devil was a colossal mistake. Now that Senator Hatch has come out and stood with McConnell, surely more Senators   especially those who have criticized Trump in the past   are sure to follow. Susan Collins (R-ME), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), John McCain (R-AZ), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) come to mind, for starters.Trump has no idea what he has done by declaring war on McConnell. These people have the power to end his presidency   and perhaps even his freedom   if he isn t careful. So, let the GOP infighting and the Trump bullying continue.Pop your popcorn, folks.

1,Fake,"August 10, 2017",News,"Donald Trump seems to think that he can bully Congress into doing his bidding, even though they are a separate and co-equal branch of government. His current target is Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who Trump is blaming for the failure of the disastrous Trumpcare bill that would have taken healthcare from millions. First, Trump ordered McConnell to  get back to work  on the healthcare bill, as if McConnell works for him. Now, during a presser amid the North Korea crisis, Trump suggested that at some point McConnell should step down as Senate Majority Leader.When Trump was asked about his attacks on McConnell and his feelings on whether or not the Senate GOP leader should continue in the post, he said: I ll tell you what, if he doesn t get repeal and replace done, and if he doesn t get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn t get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure, he doesn t get them done, then you can ask me that question. Trump then made it clear that he intends to continue hammering McConnell in public, and he wants the help of the press in doing so: That means ask me that question. Let s hope he gets it done. This is a very clear warning shot, and we know that Trump is a bully. He is angry that he has been humiliated on his signature campaign promise, which is to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act on day one. It is now well past the 200 day mark, and the GOP has proven that even with control of all three branches of the federal government they cannot achieve anything major on the legislative front. It is clear that Trump is taking this personally, that he is feeling aggrieved, and that right now he blames Mitch McConnell for that failure.McConnell better use his Article 1 powers and check the orange fool sitting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He should see now that no one is safe from Trump s ire if he believes they have done something disloyal, something to betray him.McConnell would be wise to push back, lest he allow Trump to believe that he can be pushed out by an unruly wannabe dictator.Read more:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Trump Comes For McConnell AGAIN With Latest Statement: ‘Fulfill My Campaign Promises For Me Or Quit’

Trump says his words weren t strong enough. Maybe it wasn t tough enough,  the president told reporters on Thursday at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J.  It s about time someone stuck up for the people of our country. Source: PoliticoNorth Korea s leader, Kim Jong Un, the other petulant man-child in this pissing match, hasn t yet responded, but he has twice, as a response to Trump s  fire and fury  threat, threatened to nuke Guam.The intelligence community believes that North Korea has developed a miniaturized nuclear warhead that is small enough to fit into a long-range missile, leading to speculation that if Kim John Un wanted to attack the United States, he could.Even Trump s own White House is conflicted on how to handle it, though. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has tried to mitigate Trump s irresponsible and irrational threat. Nothing that I have seen and nothing that I know of would indicate that the situation has dramatically changed in the last 24 hours,  he said, adding that  Americans should sleep well at night. But he also defended Trump s comments. I think what the President was doing was sending a strong message to North Korea in language that Kim Jong Un would understand, because he doesn t seem to understand diplomatic language,  Tillerson said. Source: CNNTrump advisor Sebastion Gorka quickly refuted Tillerson, saying: You should listen to the president; the idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical,  Gorka said in a recording shared with The Washington Post.  It is the job of Secretary Mattis, the secretary of defense, to talk about the military options, and he has done so unequivocally. He said,  Woe betide anyone who militarily challenges the United States,  and that is his portfolio. That is his mandate. Secretary Tillerson is the chief diplomat of the United States, and it is his portfolio to handle those issues. Mattis is hoping for diplomacy, but he s ready to go to war at any moment.Even if Trump is blowing smoke up Kim Jong Un s posterior, this is a dangerous line of talk, especially when dealing with a mentally unstable narcissist with daddy issues.

Manafort s shady past includes owing a fuckton of money to pro-Russian entities, money laundering, working in the Ukraine while investing with a Russian oligarch, along with other dubious business practices. Manafort has very little to lose and everything to gain by flipping on Trump. It was previously revealed that his own daughters hate him because  that money we have is blood money. It s now been reported that it was Manafort who alerted authorities to Donald Trump Jr s meeting with a Russian lawyer, which was also attended by Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner. That meeting was set up to gather damaging information on Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton.Bloomberg Politics reports:In fact, Manafort had alerted authorities to a controversial meeting on June 9, 2016, involving Trump s son Donald Jr., other campaign representatives and a Russian lawyer promising damaging information on Hillary Clinton, according to people familiar with the matter. The president and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, were dragged into the matter as details repeatedly emerged that contradicted the initial accounts of that meeting.Manafort s business associates also risk being engulfed by the probe.Federal agents conducted a pre-dawn raid late last month at a house owned by Manafort and now the investigation involves his financial interests. It appears that Mueller is going by the wise standard of following the money.Agents were looking for  tax documents and foreign banking records  when they conducted the pre-dawn raid on the morning of July 26. A spokesman for Manafort confirmed the news.Hours before the raid was conducted, Trump fired out a tweet against Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe.Immediately after the news broke of the raid on Manafort s home, the National Enquirer, a tabloid which has been in cahoots with Trump for years, predictably tweeted out their latest hit-post,  Donald Trump Advisor Paul Manafort Caught Up In Sick Sex Scandal!

However, this didn t stop him from trying to throw former president Barack Obama under the bus last night as he tried to distract America from focusing on his Russia scandal and the shortcomings of his administration.On Wednesday night, Trump retweeted two tweets that blamed Obama for the current North Korean crisis, which Trump has recently f*cked up beyond belief by threatening the regime with nuclear attacks. Those tweets were from John Bolton and Fox News   The Five , which of course were anti-Obama and patting Trump on the back for being an  unpredictable  basket case on the North Korea situation. Here are the tweets:Trump seriously cannot stand how loved Obama is by Americans, and tries to tear him down every chance he gets. Obama has a track record and popularity that Trump will never achieve, and he can t stand it. He only knows how to cope by blaming Obama for his own failures.The reason we re currently in crisis is because of Trump and his erratic threats to North Korea. Obama was a measured, thoughtful leader who never would have acted so recklessly. Trump, on the other hand, nixed the idea of negotiations and went straight to threatening nuclear war.

You have a definite connection with the boss   your speaking styles are similar, you come from the same moneyed and even geographical background, and just for good measure, let s say you both are known to engage in the occasional  locker room talk.  Honestly, you re over the moon at landing this job, because you ve been after it for half a year, and god knows there have been some twerps standing in your way.There s really only one thing you should be concerned with, and that s knowing how to do this. Maybe Anthony Scaramucci got so excited to work for Donald Trump that he forgot to learn that last part. And if this hypothetical were about you, dear reader, I can t imagine that you d overlook a teensy detail like knowing how to do things  off the record. The Mooch s downfall came from the hilariously bad telephone conversation he had with Ryan Lizza, Washington correspondent for the New Yorker. Scaramucci called Lizza to try and ascertain the identity of a  leaker  who had told him about a dinner Donald Trump attended. That phone call was, as everyone now knows, recorded.Now Mooch is claiming that Ryan Lizza broke the law. Or rather, he s insinuating it..@RyanLizza is the Linda Tripp of 2017. People know. And he is up at night not being able to live with himself.  Anthony Scaramucci (@Scaramucci) August 10, 2017Linda Tripp, of course, is the woman who recorded over 20 hours of telephone conversations with Monica Lewinski, whose dalliances with Bill Clinton ended with impeachment in the House of Representatives. There are questions to this day whether or not Tripp broke the law: Maryland law still dictates that all parties must consent to the taping of a phone call, but courts there ruled at the time that the law didn t apply to people who didn t know it was illegal. She broke the law, but if she didn t know she was breaking the law, she didn t break it. Ooookay.So of course that led to the question:Are you accusing him of taping the call without your permission?

We learned from the phone call to Lizza that Mooch believed  leaking  his (publicly available) financial disclosures to the press wasn t just a crime but a felony for which he promised to involve the FBI and DOJ. So does he think Lizza (hashtag lowlife), by recording without his  permission,  broke the law as well?Turns out it doesn t matter. In Washington D.C.   where both ends of the phone call took place   taping a telephone conversation requires only the consent of one party. Don t wonder too long about whether hitting a button to start recording is consent from one: It is. And from his tweets today, Ryan Lizza is definitely not losing sleep over it.Sorry, Mooch.

1,Fake,"August 10, 2017",News,"By now, everyone is aware of how Donald Trump s openly white supremacist campaign and subsequent  presidency  has mainstreamed the most extreme of the fringe right-wing. Despite this fact, though, these people are hardly popular. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that as these freaks are holding what is sure to be one of their biggest rallies in a really long time   likely more than ten years   , they are desperate to make sure it s a hit. How are they planning to do this? By making it, quote,  sexy.  In bigoted alt-right language, though, that simply means,  no fat people allowed. One of the organizers of the white supremacist  Unite the Right  rally that is to take place in Charlottesville, Virginia, Andrew Anglin, is the piece of sh*t who runs the white supremacist internet hole The Daily Stormer. He said, via a blog post, that he expects his fellow neo-Nazis to be  sexy,  and that they  have to go to the gym.  Anglin goes on to sternly warn against baggy clothes and other typical  fat  attire: The worst look ever is a baggy T-shirt. Wear fitted T-shirts, where the sleeve goes to the middle of your bicep. It should not hang lower than base of your member. Anglin then models an outfit in some sort of store mirror, with the following description of how his members should present themselves: Jean [sic] should also be fitted. Not tight, just fitted. In the photo those are actually shorts   I would not wear pants that loose-fitting. And that s another thing: don t ever wear shorts. Serious men in serious situations are not wearing shorts.Americans have an obsession with this baggy stuff, and it always looks bad. No matter what, it looks bad. Even if everyone else is doing it. And in case his readers didn t get it the first couple of times, Anglin then goes all in, saying:Fat people should be allowed to join groups and be involved in rallies, but we need to create a culture where we don t necessarily shame people, but do look at them and expect them to get it together. We should help people get it together. I m working on my biggest diet guide ever, which I think will help the overweight and skinny alike, even if they ve minimal time for exercise.Continued obesity should not be tolerated.Surely, a lot of our target demographic is going to be out of shape, which is why we need a culture of fitness. People should go to the gym together. Help each other with diet.Do not look scraggly. I won t tell you how to cut your hair, but I do believe men s hair looks better short, and beards look better well-trimmed.On top of this, Anglin reveals himself to be extremely misogynistic, and insists that women be shunted to the side. He also says that he, himself, has, quote,  problems with women.  He does want to be appealing to the fairer sex, though, and wants his rank and file white supremacists to be the same:Look good.It is very important to look good.We must have Chad Nationalism. That is what will make guys want to join us, that is what will make girls want to be our groupies. That will make us look like bad boys and heroes. That is what we are going for here.I cannot stress the point hard enough   I m hitting italics again   we need to be extremely conscious of what we look like, and how we present ourselves. That matters more than our ideas. If that is sad to you, I m sorry, but that is just human nature. If people see a bunch of mismatched overweight slobs, they are not going to care what they are saying. Of course, Anglin and his disgusting cohorts will use the promise of hot women as a way to drag people into their despicable ideology.This is all an obvious and explicit message of ,  no fatties allowed, you make us look bad.  Then again, it makes sense. People like Anglin and another prominent alt-right leader, Richard Spencer, are trying to rebrand the extreme, bigoted right. they cannot do that if they associate themselves with uneducated, fat, toothless, trailer park dwellers who most people think of when they think of the racist right.It doesn t make it right, and all of what they are doing and what they are about is as wrong as it comes. However, it seems that for a so-called  movement  that is still very unpopular and disgraceful even in many GOP circles, they d be trying to get all the numbers they can, no matter what the people attending look like.Then again, these people are white supremacists, and there is nothing rational about them or anything they do.Featured image via Facebook"," Desperate For Members, White Supremacists Beg Rally Goers To Make It ‘Sexy’ – No Joke"
1,Fake,"August 9, 2017",News,"The LA Times is reporting that the Federal Bureau of Investigation carried out a search warrant on the campaign office of Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in relation to misappropriated funds during the campaign. Specifically, they searched the campaign treasurer s office for documents and electronic records related to campaign spending.This is far from the first time Duncan Hunter has made his way into the news cycle for misusing campaign funds, so it should come as no surprise that the investigation has gone this far. As the LA Times reports:It was the more than $1,300 in video game purchases by Hunter s campaign that first drew the attention of federal election officials and the San Diego Union-Tribune. Hunter blamed his son for the video game purchases, saying he had used the wrong credit card. Other unusual spending by Hunter s campaign included a now-infamous airplane ride for the family rabbit and payments to nail salons, his children s private school and a Phoenix resort. Hunter has already reimbursed his campaign some $62,000 for payments of items such as oral surgery, a family trip to Italy and Disneyland gift shop purchases. And his most recent campaign finance reports show he has spent $336,664 with seven law firms this year, much of that since the House Ethics Committee announced it was stalling its investigation to avoid interfering with the FBI s work.Hunter defended his actions by saying,  I was not involved in any criminal action,  Hunter said.  Maybe I wasn t attentive enough to my campaign. That s not a crime. He s far from the only Republican to blatantly flout campaign finance and anti-corruption laws, though. Trump, for example, is under investigation by several watchdogs for spending heavily at his own businesses, often paying rates above market value or raising prices to make more money from his campaign donors. Former Rep. Michael Grimm was recently convicted and sentenced to eight months. The list goes on and on.If this year has proven anything, it s that Republicans have no respect for the rule of law, and are simply desperate for guidance from an authoritarian ruler no matter how dirty he or his political party may be.Hey Republicans   this is America.

Here s how, per the Associated Press:BREAKING: North Korea says it will complete plan to attack waters near Guam by mid-August then wait for commander in chief s order.  The Associated Press (@AP) August 9, 2017Trump s latest threats followed news that North Korea has figured out that they actually can put nuclear warheads on their missiles. That includes long-range missiles that might be able to hit our West Coast. That they re now vowing to carry through with plans to attack one of our territories shows the folly of Trump s so-called leadership in the area of foreign policy.North Korea sees Guam as a type of beachhead from which we can launch an attack on them. They ve already been working on long-range ballistic missiles, and they ve been testing nuclear weapons for a long time. It s like Trump is taunting North Korea the way a schoolyard bully would.He needs to take this more seriously than he is, and let the grown-ups do the work here.

And for all of its imperfections, we depend on that international order to protect our own freedom.In other words, we are a nation that, at our best, has been defined by hope, and not fear.

1,Fake,"August 9, 2017",News,"As her husband Donald Trump makes Twitter threats of nuclear war to North Korea, First Lady Melania Trump has decided to abandon her crusade to tackle cyber bullying and instead move on to drug addiction.Melania made a rare appearance on Twitter yesterday to promote her new cause because her cyber bullying campaign isn t going very well, particularly because her husband ruins its credibility on a daily basis. Melania tweeted: Opioids are destroying our youth/people. Mtg w @Potus & @SecPriceMD today to give my support to #STOPDRUGADDICTION. When Melania first announced her passion for ending cyber bullying, it raised eyebrows around the world, especially considering the fact that her husband is infamous for attacking people on social media. However, Melania hasn t actually talked about her cyber bullying plan of action since January and seems to have pivoted onto to drug addiction. A spokesperson for Melania Trump told The New York Daily News that Melania s concerns for children were the reason for her new interest in drug addiction. The spokesperson said: Opioid abuse is an escalating health crisis affecting countless families across the country. The well-being of children is a priority for the first lady, and this epidemic affects them in many different ways so she requested to attend today s briefing. For someone who cares so much about children, it would be great if Melania would show some concern about the innocent children who would be killed if Trump gets us into a nuclear war with North Korea. Trump has now been threatening and bullying North Korea for two days now on Twitter, and the situation only continues to get uglier with time.Together, Trump and Melania are the most incompetent, ineffective and dangerous couple the White House has ever housed.

1,Fake,"August 9, 2017",News,"Speculation about Vice-President Mike Pence s political aspirations to position himself in Trump s Oval Office chair will likely get another jolt after it was reported that he tapped campaign operative, Nick Ayers, to be his chief of staff.Ayers spent months quietly bending Pence s ear to warn him that Donald Trump s troubles could cause collateral damage and that he needed to take a more aggressive position on a range of issues in order to ensure that he enters the post-Trump era on solid ground, according to two White House officials, Politico reports.There s been a lot of speculation that Pence will run in 2020 if Trump cannot, considering that his boss is plagued with scandals while only on the job for 7 months. Even political satirist Andy Horowitz wrote a piece titled,  Mike Pence considering running for president in 1820. But, President Pence emphatically denied the possibility of a 2020 run.In a statement released by the White House, Pence said Sunday s story in The New York Times  is disgraceful and offensive to me, my family, and our entire team.  He added that  the allegations in this article are categorically false. However, just before Anthony Scarmucci was kicked of Trump Island as the White House communications director, he suggested to New Yorker writer Ryan Lizza that the Vice-President can t believe what s going on with his boss. Why do you think Nick s there, bro?  Scaramucci told Lizza in an interview last month, shortly before being fired.  Are you stupid? Why is Nick there? Nick s there to protect the Vice-President because the Vice-President can t believe what the f*ck is going on. On top of that, Pence is headed to Latin America after requesting to secure 700 visas for his team.A diplomatic source called the number of visas  curious  because it dwarfed even the advance teams for President Barack Obama s trip to Brazil, Chile and El Salvador combined in 2011.But yeah, he s totally not preparing to sit in the Oval Office. Nope. Not at all. How long will it take before Trump lashes out at his Vice-President? We re pretty sure he cannot fire Pence.

1,Fake,"August 9, 2017",News,"Most of us in the U.S. are well aware of Donald Trump s extreme obsession with former President Barack Obama, but now we know that foreign diplomats are privy to that, too. Top-ranking European officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, told BuzzFeed News what they think of Trump and what their chief concerns were. Trump s erratic and unpredictable Twitter use was brought up as well. Also discussed was Trump s lack of a strong, experienced team around him.In total, six top European government officials who ve had firsthand dealings on the international stage with Trump and his administration were interviewed by BuzzFeed and their views are consistent.At international gatherings, Trump is described as  something of a laughing stock. Trump could send a tweet in the middle of the night pissing off Kim Jong Un. And the next morning we wake up to a world on the brink of war,  one diplomat said.That observation was made before Trump tried to start a nuclear war on Twitter so we can only imagine how he or she feels now.One of the officials went as far as to say that a small group of diplomats play a version of word bingo whenever Trump speaks because they consider his vocabulary to be so limited.  Everything is  great ,  very, very great ,  amazing ,  the diplomat said of Trump s vocabulary.But there s also a fear among our allies that Trump is dangerous. He has no historical view. He is only dealing with these issues now, and seems to think the world started when he took office,  a diplomat told BuzzFeed News.  He thinks that NATO existed only to keep the communists out of Europe. He has a similar attitude in Asia-Pacific with Japan, ignoring that the US basically wrote their constitution. The diplomats said they also believe that Trump s foreign policy is chiefly driven by an obsession with unraveling former President Barack Obama s policies, and we ve pretty much seen that, too, here in the U.S. It s his only real position,  one official said.  He will ask:  Did Obama approve this?  And if the answer is affirmative, he will say:  We don t.  He won t even want to listen to the arguments or have a debate. He is obsessed with Obama. Another diplomat said that it s impossible to discuss serious international issues, such as Libya, with Trump. They have growing concerns because they re still struggling to find someone in his administration to engage with because meeting with Trump has proved to be  basically useless. He s not the kind of person you can have a discussion about how to deal with [Fayez] al-Sarraj [the prime minister of Libya],  the official added.  So you look for people around him, and that is where it s a problem: The constant upheaval, it s unclear who has influence, who is close to the president. We feel their pain. We witnessed Trump s obsession and profound jealousy of Obama when he tried to claim that our country s first black President is really a sneaky Muslim from Kenya. The former reality show star tried to delegitimize Obama but he failed to do so because facts got in his way. That s still the main problem with Trump. He s adverse to facts. But, he did sell himself on the campaign trail to people who thought they could stick it to liberals by siding with the former reality show star, a man with zero political experience.

Federal agents conducted a pre-dawn raid late last month at a house owned by former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.The Washington Post reports that the FBI raided Manafort s home in Alexandria, Virginia, with agents armed with a search warrant that they used to seize documents and  other materials,  the Washington Post reports. The search warrant was wide-ranging and FBI agents working with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III departed the home with various records,  the Post writes.  The raid came as Manafort has been voluntarily producing documents to congressional committees investigating Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. The search warrant indicates investigators may have argued to a federal judge they had reason to believe Manafort could not be trusted to turn over all records in response to a grand jury subpoena. It s possible that Mueller is trying to get Manafort to flip on Trump and his associates:Manafort s allies fear that Mueller hopes to build a case against Manafort unrelated to the 2016 campaign, in hopes that the former campaign operative would provide information against others in Trump s inner circle in exchange for lessening his own legal exposure.Manafort might want to consider a deal with Mueller, after all, it was previously revealed that he worked for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine.On March 22, The Associated Press reported that Manafort was paid the hefty sum of $10 million between 2006 and 2009 to lobby on behalf of Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, a close ally of Vladimir Putin s. The New York Times reported recently that Manafort was indebted to pro-Russian interests as late as last year. Investigators are also probing whether Manafort engaged in money laundering.It was also revealed that Manafort was indebted to pro-Russian interests and investigators have been probing whether Manafort engaged in money laundering, according to The Wall Street Journal.Manafort served as Trump s campaign chairman for several months before he was ousted over his ties to Kremlin-backed political figures in Ukraine.

Except the threat isn t coming from the Russians this time, but our own president.On Tuesday, Trump threatens to rain  fire and fury  upon North Korea, which resulted in Kim Jong-Un threatening to bomb Guam.Trump s irresponsible threats made the country gasp in horror. After all, Trump has been obsessed with nuclear weapons since the 2016 campaign and is mentally unstable enough that he may actually use them to retaliate against even the smallest personal slight against him.Hillary Clinton was right when she warned that,  A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons. On Wednesday morning, Trump bragged about America s nuclear arsenal on his Twitter feed and promised that America would remain the most powerful nation on Earth because of it. He even had the audacity to claim that he is responsible for the renovation of the arsenal.My first order as President was to renovate and modernize our nuclear arsenal. It is now far stronger and more powerful than ever before .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017 Hopefully we will never have to use this power, but there will never be a time that we are not the most powerful nation in the world!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2017For the record, it was President Obama who ordered a sweeping renovation of America s nuclear arsenal in 2014. So once again, Trump gets caught taking credit for something President Obama did.In addition, Donald Trump must not be aware that Russia has more nuclear weapons than the United States.And, finally, America s nuclear arsenal does not make us the most powerful nation in the world. It now makes us the number one threat against it because of Trump.Forcing Trump out of office has never been more important than it is right now. Because failure to do so could result in trying to survive a nuclear apocalypse caused by a petulant child.Read more:Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Trump Brags About How Powerful America’s Nuclear Arsenal Is In Scary Twitter Post
1,Fake,"August 9, 2017",News,"There are no two crazy people ever mentioned more in the news than the leaders of West and East, Donald Trump and Kim Jong-Un. For the citizens of America and North Korea, unfortunately, no two crazy leaders are more alike. From out-of-control hair to ludicrous proclamations, Trump and Kim are like brothers from another (deeply disturbed) mother.We thought we d take a look at some of the ways the two are alike, starting with what we ve already mentioned Kim Jong-Un was the undisputed world champion of insanity until right around the middle of Trump s run at the presidency here in the United States. How could anyone compete with Kim s reclamation of one half hour from the Japanese on August 15, 2015, 96 years after the Korean dignitary says Japan  stole time  from North Korea? It s hard to keep up with a man who learned to drive at only age three.Trump does his best, though. On day one of his presidency, he insisted that it stopped raining just as he began to give his inaugural address   which was news to those in attendance getting wet as it began raining at precisely that moment. That same day, Donald looked out at a crowd roughly half the size of the previous inauguration to take place and declared it  the biggest crowd at any inauguration, ever. Kim is famous for using doctored video to fake missile launches, a  show  of his military prowess and resolve. Trump prefers to lie the old-fashioned way: by just making shit up and hoping nobody calls him on it. We don t actually have room here for a more complete documentation of all of the outright lies from either Toddler Tyrant, but rest assured that the lists are extensive. although their rallies look slightly different:Uniforms, flowers, and colorful dresses line the streets of North Ko-razy (Pool/Getty)Fans display a makeshift sign made of used beer cases (Justin Merriman/Getty)In July, upon release of the Hwasong 14 missile, Kim (who is literally never seen out of uniform) reportedly  expressed satisfaction, saying it looked as handsome as a good-looking boy and was well made. Just one month earlier, Trump was waxing romantic about his own terrible toys, pitching the sale of  beautiful military equipment because nobody makes it like the United States  while he was in the Middle East. There was no uniform for Trump that day, but only because he wasn t on an aircraft carrier.Remember that time Kim Jong-Un said,  It would be perfect for Obama to live with a group of monkeys in the world s largest African natural zoo and lick the breadcrumbs thrown by spectators  through the Korean Central News Agency?I d pretty much put an equals sign between that and the time Trump told the former president of Trump Plaza Hotel & Casino that  laziness is a trait in blacks. Frankly, that s gross, so I m not going to spend a whole lot of time on this entry, other than to say that Trump s  you can do anything  looks exactly the same to me as Kim s  Pleasure Squad. So this one s kind of misleading: Kim Jong-Un inherited a State Media from his dad. They pretty much just say whatever he tells them to say, and he has the final word on whether anything anyone in his country ever says makes it into print. There is no internet for regular citizens in North Korea.Trump, on the other hand, is trying to get there by delegitimizing our constitutionally-protected press and supporting television programming that serves as propaganda.Maybe you ve heard of some of North Korea s brutal executions for  crimes  as petty as falling asleep during an event. But do you remember that time Donald Trump took out full-page ads in every paper in New York calling for the execution of the  Central Park Five,  a group of teenage boys who were coerced into confessing to a rape they didn t commit? They were completely exonerated by DNA evidence, and reimbursed $41 million by the state for their ordeal. Trump reiterated his belief that the boys (then men) were guilty as recently as 2016.  What were they doing in the Park, playing checkers?  he tweeted a few years back. To recap the last four horrid sentences: Trump wanted the death penalty for a non-capital crime that the people didn t commit.How could I forget this one? Although we don t know the extent of Kim Jong-Un s corruption, we can make a pretty educated guess, based on the fact that like his father before him, he lives like a king while the citizens of North Korea literally eat sawdust to keep from starving.Trump s corruption, however, can be more accurately tracked because there are websites dedicated to chronicling it all. I would hate to see the internet run out of available pages, though, so hopefully we get rid of this guy soon. In fact, he never should have been president in the first place, because like all fascists The Kim family, of course, has always been in power in the secretive kingdom. But that doesn t stop them from  electing  their leaders   who run unopposed, of course.Trump s dark ties to Russia, however, may prove to be the end of his presidency. For all the indignity we ve suffered in even allowing Donald Trump to assume the presidency of the United States, we at least still have a constitution and some semblance of democracy. And we have something North Koreans don t: Bob Muller and a grand jury.I m sure you could comment on this with more examples of similarities between the two Supreme Leaders. In fact, feel free! But bookmark the page for when you get into arguments on the internet   there are a lot of useful links in this article. In fact, forward this thing to your right-wing uncle, and tell him to click everything he sees.It can t possibly hurt him to know his favorite politician is basically a crazy Asian dictator.Read more:Featured image via Wikimedia Commons", 10 Reasons Donald Trump And Kim Jong-Un Are Basically The Same Person

1,Fake,"August 8, 2017",News,"Two man-children with access to nuclear weapons are having a pissing match and the world is hoping and praying that like much of what Donald Trump says, it s all talk. A resurfaced video from 1999, though, shows that Trump has wanted to send nukes to North Korea since at least then, even though that s not what he thinks he wanted.This is what the world saw today from Donald Trump, after reports indicated that North Korea had miniaturized a nuclear warhead that could, in theory, reach the United States: North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States,  Trump said, arms crossed, from his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, on Tuesday.  They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen. Source: CNNWe don t actually know for sure that North Korea has miniaturized the warhead, or that it s been tested, but nonetheless, Trump seems ready to push that button.We could try to console ourselves by saying that like with his supposed wall, Trump is just talking tough, but this kind of tough talk has been going on for at least 18 years from Trump.A recently resurfaced video of a Meet the Press episode from 1999 shows a far more articulate Trump talking to Tim Russert about North Korea (why the hell was Tim Russert talking to Donald Trump about North Korea is still a mystery). Trump was full of tough talk even then.He began the segment by saying he would  negotiate like crazy  with North Korea.Then Trump just had to throw in a barely veiled racist jab at Washington, D.C. Look Tim, if a man walks up to you in a street in Washington because this doesn t happen of course in New York and puts a gun to your head and says  give me your money,  wouldn t you rather know where he was coming from before he had the gun in his hand? Trump went on to predict that in three to four years, North Korea would have nuclear weapons pointed at the United States. They didn t. They still don t. He then said,  we can talk about the economy, we can talk about social security, but the biggest problem the world has is nuclear proliferation.  Of course, that was before DT took over the Oval Office.Trump quickly pivoted from negotiation to a preemptive strike, to which Russert noted that a former Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, said that the nuclear fallout from a preemptive strike would be  devastating to the Asian Peninsula. Trump then clutched his chest, saying,  I m not talking about us using nuclear weapons. I m saying that they have areas where they re developing missiles. Russert interrupted Trump to say that by taking out their nuclear missiles, it would create the fallout, no matter who sent the weapons.Trump then began to get belligerent, saying we need to do something or in five years, they would have nuclear weapons  all over the place.  Again, they didn t and they don t. But Trump now has access to the largest military in the world and one of the largest nuclear arsenals in the world. Every Asian country, including our largest trading partner, China, is now either publicly or privately terrified and now that we know that Trump has been sitting on this fantasy for at least 18 years, we should all be.Here s the video:Tim Russert interviewing @realDonaldTrump in 1999 about launching a pre-emptive strike against North Korea.

1,Fake,"August 8, 2017",News,"I mean, that headline, right? Did someone actually say that?At this point, you shouldn t be surprised. Donald Trump is a conspiracy-spouting, heartless, right wing douchebag. Why wouldn t every single member of his administration be? Now, I have a pretty special hate for Steve Bannon, because I have a crippling fear of toad-men (a holdover from a game of charades with my great uncle Eivind when I was eight). But coming in at a very close second for my deep-seeded loathing is Sebastian Gorka, a dude who wears Nazi paraphernalia in public and is probably totally a really real Nazi, you guys.For some reason, news people keep inviting Gorka to come say horrible things on their shows, and he keeps not letting anyone down. Monday, it was MSNBC s Ali Velshi and Stephanie Ruhle who were tasked with tolerating Gorka s condescending bullshit for a few minutes, and he was just full of witty goodness. When the hosts asked him why Donald Trump had not yet made a public statement about the terrorist bombing in Minnesota, you could see the disgust and contempt on his face:There s a great rule: All initial reports are false. You have to check them and find out who the perpetrators are. We ve had a series of crimes committed, alleged hate crimes by right wing individuals in the last six months that turned out to be propagated by the left. Let s allow the local authorities to provide their assessment and then the White House will make its comments.There is a lot to unpack there. I suggest we just focus on the obvious: That there s been exactly one attack  propagated by the left  in the last six months, and it was never at any point presumed to have been a right-winger. Like, we knew within the hour what political campaign the guy had worked for.Let s not do too much separation here, though. Gorka is part and parcel of an administration that would say all the same things, no matter who the talking head was. This is an administration that is seriously trying to pretend like a bomb thrown through a mosque window  might actually have been some Alex Jones-like  false flag  perpetrated by someone on the left.That s despicable.

1,Fake,"August 8, 2017",News,"You almost have to feel sorry for Republicans (almost). They find themselves between a really unpopular president and a party that only rewards those who are perfectly loyal to Dear Orange Leader.Ronna Romney McDaniel, the current head of the Republican National Committee and niece of the last Republican presidential loser, Mitt Romney, says that not supporting Donald Trump should be a cautionary tale for any Republican that ever hopes to win another election.On CNN s Laura Ingraham Show, McDaniel tried to pretend that the RNC stays out of primaries, but that GOP Sen. Jeff Flake was sure to lose because, unlike the toy brown-shirted robots in Congress, he refused to march (at least on paper) to Trump s xenophobic (and generally everything phobic) message.Flake wrote a book called  Conscience of a Conservative: A Rejection of Destructive Politics and a Return to Principle,  a title he only partly stole from Barry Goldwater.Flake dared take on Trump and his own party, saying that Trump is a symptom of a dying party. But make no mistake, as a governing philosophy, conservatism is indeed in crisis   and not in spite of this apparent success but because of it,  later blasting self-described conservatives for changing their political stripes  depending on fashion or the passions of the day or based on how much applause a line in a speech received at a rally. We have given in to the politics of anger   the belief that riling up the base can make up for failed attempts to broaden the electorate,  Flake writes.  These are the spasms of a dying party. Source: NPRNow the party is pissed. McDaniel fell short of threatening Flake, but the implication was clear as day   if Republicans don t support Trump, they will likely lose. They need to have another candidate that they supported and the three RNC members that have to agree on that other candidate for rule 11 to apply, but it is in their bylaws,  McDaniel said.  It s just interesting from a party standpoint, we do have governance. We have 168 members that they make those decisions. Sometimes you get in the nitty gritty, but I will say if you look at 2016, the senators that did not support the President, and let s look at Joe Heck and Kelly Ayotte, they fell short in those Senate races, so there is a cautionary tale there because voters want you to support the President in his agenda. Source: CNNWe should note that Flake votes with Trump 93.5 percent of the time. I guess his conscience is that of a man who wants to sell books.McDaniel, of course, neglects to mention that during the election, Trump s approval ratings were sort of close to 50 percent. Now, he s below 40 percent. Between his inability to negotiate deals of any kind and his efforts to take health insurance away from his own base, people are beginning to turn on him. It s not the same political climate as it was just a few months ago, so seeing the 2016 election as a cautionary tale for anything (other than letting Russians interfere) is pretty much moot.What this does say, though, is that Republicans aren t going to be turning on Trump anytime soon and that impeachment will be an uphill battle, at least if they want the support of their party, which of course, is more important than their country.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", RNC Chair’s Comment Reveals Why Republicans May Never Turn On Trump

Their failure to repeal and replace Obamacare was a multi-failure disaster that made the GOP the laughingstock of politics, with Trump championing the train wreck. Now, Republicans are desperate to save the last remaining strands of dignity the party might have, and some are throwing Trump under the bus.CNN has just reported that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is blaming Trump for giving the Republican Party a horrible reputation and making them look incompetent and incapable of governing. In a whiny rant in which he complained that Trump is making him look bad, McConnell said: Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process. More specifically, McConnell insisted that the GOP is working just fine. In the same breath, he pointed the finger at Trump s tendency to give the GOP artificial deadlines for legislature. Part of the reason I think people think we re under-performing is because of too many artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality of the legislature which may have not been understood. It s not surprising that McConnell is going after Trump now   he s become increasingly frustrated with Trump s failure to understand how to run a country or how the government actually works. While Trump is certainly to blame for being a total imbecile and having ridiculously unrealistic expectations of what he can actually get done, McConnell s leadership in the Senate has been highly flawed.Of course, McConnell and Trump are not going to take any responsibility for their part and will just keep blaming each other as the GOP continues to crash and burn.

From the article:Other lawsuits against Trump, on emoluments grounds, have been filed, including one by the governments of Maryland and the District of Columbia (none have yet been decided), but Blumenthal believes that his suit will be the one that survives a challenge on standing grounds.  The clause specifically says that the President needs the consent of Congress to receive this money from foreign countries, so he s deprived us of the chance to give our consent,  Blumenthal said.  I think that s enough for us to get into court. Notably, if Judge Emmet Sullivan, of the federal district court in Washington, allows the case to proceed, the plaintiffs may be allowed to obtain Trump s elusive tax returns as part of the discovery process.So there s that. Looks like Mr. PhonyPants McDraftDodger was doing a little projecting about Vietnam because he was afraid of the war Blumenthal is bringing down on him, right here at home.Blumenthal had the last laugh:Mr. President: Your bullying hasn't worked before and it won't work now.

That was the first full six months of Obama s second term.And Trump has only managed to add 1.07, which, as shown above, is lower than Obama s 1.08 for his final six months.

Pruitt has stated on far too many occasions that he absolutely does not believe that carbon dioxide emissions are a primary contributor to global warming. Although it explains his position, the irony is that Pruitt has no scientific background whatsoever. If he did, he couldn t possibly disagree with this basic scientific fact   regardless of your political position on climate change, CO  absolutely warms any environment it s found in.Knowing what we do now about the government censoring climate change data in other agencies, it feels like too much to expect this report to come out, or at least unredacted. But at least we have the leaks from our reliable press to keep us in the loop.Read more:Featured image via Lukas Schulze/Getty Images", Leaked Secret Government Report Shows Massive Impact Of Climate Change On The United States
1,Fake,"August 7, 2017",News,"Print journalism and longstanding papers have been struggling since the advent of the internet and increased competition faced by blogs and op-ed sites. That, combined with poor understanding of marketing on new platforms, has combined to really cause a struggle in the journalism industry.So, on a certain level, journalists can thank Trump. Despite unleashing a war on freedom of the press never before seen in our nation s history, he s been a boon to business, with massive public backlash against Trump and his fake news army resulting in a thirst for facts and information.Take the New York Times, for example. In the first quarter of 2017, the NYT signed on more new subscribers than any other period in history. Stock is up 50 percent. Digital advertising revenue went up nearly 20 percent. So when Donald Trump says  when is the failing NYT going to go out of business,  as he did today, the answer is  not soon.

1,Fake,"August 7, 2017",News,"Ever wonder if Donald Trump s insistence on repealing Obamacare has a motive beyond,  We need to undo everything the black man did?  Had the GOP actually been able to repeal the ACA, which contained a 3.8 percent tax on investment income that mostly affects the wealthy, Trump s cabinet would save an average of $124,200 to $313,700 on their own tax bills, according to an analysis by MapLight.Many stand to save an awful lot more than that. Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos stands to save anywhere from $1.9 million to over $4 million. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross could save up to $1.31 million. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin could find his tax bill reduced by as much as $900,000. Trump himself could save as much as $560,000 if that tax were repealed. It s not hard to see that s.This is the wealthiest cabinet in U.S. history, and many members of the top 1 percent believe in continuing to send the wealth their way instead of distributing it more fairly via fair wages and benefits, and perhaps, maybe shifting the bulk of the country s tax burden back onto those who are currently not paying their fair share.MapLight s analysis shows a possible reason why the Trump White House is so desperate to repeal Obamacare, and why Trump made it a cornerstone of his campaign. It may well not be just everything-Obama-ever-did-is-evil rhetoric. Trump stated outright during the campaign that he could be the first presidential candidate to make money off his candidacy. It s pretty much a given that he feels this way about his presidency, too.Combine that with Trump ongoing refusal to release his tax returns, and it starts looking like his efforts on repealing the ACA are more because it benefits him and those in his circle, not because he cares about the American people.Further evidence of this is shown in his and the GOP s total disregard for the CBO scores on their plans, which demonstrated that repeal would harm more Americans than it would help. He s primarily motivated by self-interest, despite his ongoing assurances that all he wants to do is help regular Americans. This is just further evidence of that.Read more:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Average Trump Cabinet Member Stands To Profit By Hundreds Of Thousands From Tax ‘Reform’
1,Fake,"August 7, 2017",News,"Florida Senator Marco Rubio actually knows something the rest of us know for once: That there aren t enough racists in America   or even the Congress   to pass Donald Trump s new immigration bill. The bill would curb even legal immigration, setting a completely arbitrary limit on how many total people could come to America through traditional methods.Last Wednesday, Trump trotted out that annoying kid from the Comey hearing, Tom Cotton, and human stegosaurus David Perdue to unveil the RAISE Act, a singularly horrible piece of legislation that would among other things require proficiency in English, advanced degrees, and/or high-paying job offers in order to legally immigrate to this country. Team Trump called it  merit-based  immigration, but as an online quiz posted almost immediately by Time highlighted, even most Americans wouldn t have enough  merit  to apply for a visa.The real question is, if people without degrees, skills, or  merit,  as Trump said, are the ones coming to America, how are they stealing all of our jobs?Now Marco Rubio is on the record setting Trump and his lackeys (from two of the states that would suffer the most by curtailing immigration) straight on this bill s chances:That bill s not going to pass.   I think the White House knows that you don t have 60 votes for that in the Senate.Rubio, a Cuban-American from Miami, has some pretty understandable differences with Trump and other Republicans when it comes to immigration. After all, the unspoken fact is that every immigration bill is primarily aimed at Spanish-speaking would-be immigrants.But lest you think Marco is some kind of hero for breaking with the president on this, you have to remember   he is still a Republican:Where I probably have a big difference of opinion with this bill is that it sets an arbitrary cap on the number of people that are able to come through with a green card. I don t think that should be an arbitrary cap, that number should be driven by demand.I see. So we just let in as many as we want here. And what about the idiotic idea of advancing a 19th-century meritocracy?In 2013 the very controversial Gang of Eight, four Democrats and four Republicans, proposed moving legal immigration to a merit-based system.But  Wasn t Marco one of the four Republicans he s talking about?

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017This despicable attack against a man who actually wore the uniform of his country for six years as a United States Marine is just the latest example of Trump insulting members of our armed forces.Here s are five more.Early on in his campaign, Trump insulted Senator John McCain, who spent years as a prisoner of war during Vietnam suffering gruesome torture that affects him to this day. He chose to undergo that torture rather than be released before other soldiers, because he had connections they did not. He s not a war hero,  Trump said.  He s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren t captured. McCain is a recipient of the Purple Heart and a Silver Star among many other decorations in recognition of his service and sacrifice.In the final months of the campaign, Trump attacked a Gold Star family for simply challenging him to read the Constitution.Khizr and Ghazala Khan spoke to the Democratic National Convention in opposition to Trump and his racism against Muslims. Trump responded by smearing the Khans, suggesting that Ghazala was forbidden from speaking.Their son, Captain Humayun Khan, was killed in Iraq while saving the lives of his fellow soldiers. He was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his sacrifice.A month prior to the election, Trump appeared to suggest that veterans with PTSD are weak. When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat   and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over and you re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can t handle it. In August 2016, Trump once again belittled the service of wounded veterans by taking a Purple Heart as a gift from a veteran, remarking that getting one this way was much easier than getting one the hard way. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart. This was much easier. The worst insult to veterans is the fact that Trump repeatedly dodged the draft during Vietnam. He received five deferments during the war despite being physically fit and having gone to military school.Trump was finally declared medically unfit because of a supposed bone spur in his foot, a condition that even seasoned professional athletes play through.It should also be noted that Trump has failed to produce any evidence proving that his bone spur was real.Trump would later remark that his  personal Vietnam  was sleeping around and not getting a sexually transmitted disease. Trump s  personal Vietnam  was taking place at the same time John McCain was still working to recover from his injuries during the real Vietnam War.And those examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Since taking office, Trump insulted World War II veterans by ranting on Twitter instead of honoring the anniversary of D-Day and insulted veterans across the nation by attacking transgender service members.Donald Trump can say he loves the troops all he wants. His past words and actions make it clear that he is lying every time he makes such a declaration.

What do all of these people have in common, aside from terrible taste in employers?They all came from Goldman Sachs, the Wall Street powerhouse that made billions of dollars during the subprime mortgage crisis that tanked the American economy beginning in 2007.Much has been made of the hypocrisy of Donald Trump s claims of  draining the swamp.  He simultaneously hired and promoted many of the same (and some even worse) swamp-dwellers that made Washington, D.C. into the quagmire of grift, corruption, and greed that constituted the bog that needed its plug pulled. But all we knew until now was that those assholes were still in positions of authority. We had no idea what kind of impact they were having on Trump s presidency, outside of tax proposals that screw ordinary Americans and drastically reduce rates for people like themselves.But now an analysis from the Wall Street Journal is shedding some light on a more nefarious aspect of their influence on Trump policy:Wall Street regulators have imposed far lower penalties in the first six months of Donald Trump s presidency than they did during the first six months of 2016, a comparable period in the Obama administration.If you re like me, you know that Wall Street isn t suddenly behaving itself   so why the change?It comes from another of Trump s campaign promises: To destroy Dodd-Frank, the now 7 year-old bill signed by Barack Obama that aimed to  reform  Wall Street after the fallout from the massive recession they were essentially solely responsible for. Life savings were lost, the housing market was upended, and ultimately the US economy tanked, resulting in bailouts for the big banks that both parties hated. Back on April 11, Trump met with a bunch of CEOs and told them they didn t have to worry much longer:For the bankers in the room, they ll be very happy because we re really doing a major streamlining and, perhaps, elimination, and replacing it with something else.But Trump s drive to dismantle the landmark legislation still hasn t taken effect, so in the meantime, what his administration can do to make life easier for Wall Street   literally the only people who will benefit from the destruction of Dodd-Frank   is to back off the penalty part of the  horrendous  regulations Dodd-Frank imposed.

In fact, they are no longer even supposed to use the words  climate change  at all.According to emails between staff at the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the staff has been told to use the term weather extremes  instead.The Guardian reports the following regarding an email dated February 16:A missive from Bianca Moebius-Clune, director of soil health, lists terms that should be avoided by staff and those that should replace them.  Climate change  is in the  avoid  category, to be replaced by  weather extremes . Instead of  climate change adaption , staff are asked to use  resilience to weather extremes .The primary cause of human-driven climate change is also targeted, with the term  reduce greenhouse gases  blacklisted in favor of  build soil organic matter, increase nutrient use efficiency . Meanwhile,  sequester carbon  is ruled out and replaced by  build soil organic matter .Moebius-Clune explained that we won t change the modeling, just how we talk about it   there are a lot of benefits to putting carbon back in the sail [sic], climate mitigation is just one of them.  She claims a colleague from the USDA s public affairs team advised them to  tamp down on discretionary messaging right now. Jimmy Bramblett, deputy chief for programs at the NRCS told senior employees that Trump was behind the decision to begin censoring important climate change data. It has become clear one of the previous administration s priority is not consistent with that of the incoming administration. Namely, that priority is climate change. Please visit with your staff and make them aware of this shift in perspective within the executive branch,  Bramblett wrote on January 24.The USDA issued a statement on January 23 that said,  interim operating procedures outlining procedures to ensure the new policy team has an opportunity to review policy-related statements, legislation, budgets, and regulations prior to issuance. This guidance, similar to procedures issued by previous administrations, was misinterpreted by some to cover data and scientific publications. This was never the case and USDA interim procedures will allow complete, objective information for the new policy staff reviewing policy decisions,  the statement added.And it isn t just the USDA. Since Trump took office, all mention of climate change has been scrubbed from the websites for both the White House and the Department of the Interior. The EPA has also removed its sections on climate change while they are  updating language to reflect the approach of new leadership. This is troubling, to say the least. These records reveal Trump s active censorship of science in the name of his political agenda,  said Meg Townsend, open government attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity.  To think that federal agency staff who report about the air, water, and soil that sustains the health of our nation must conform their reporting with the Trump administration s anti-science rhetoric is appalling and dangerous for America and the greater global community. 2017-NRCS-00240-A-3 by The Guardian on ScribdFeatured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", It’s Official: The United States Government Is Censoring Climate Data

1,Fake,"August 7, 2017",News,"Sinclair Broadcast Group, the media empire responsible for the vast majority of pro-Trump propaganda you ve seen on television for more than a year, is finally being rewarded by the Grifter-in-Chief. The FCC, now headed by Republican Trump-appointee Ajit Pai, has allowed the $3.9 billion purchase of Tribune Media by Sinclair. Along with the name, Sinclair now owns the 42 television stations Tribune had in its portfolio to add to Sinclair s own, which already numbered over 170 stations.But this isn t any ordinary merger of two large companies.Sinclair actually made a deal with Trump to give him favorable coverage in order for this purchase to be approved. And it was a win-win deal   for everyone but consumers. Sinclair got to increase their stranglehold on American media, and in return, Trump gets to see his interests advanced on all of their stations.Sinclair has been forcing the stations it already owned to air  must-run  segments of commentary by Boris Epshteyn, a Russia-born former Trump official. In July, Sinclair increased the number of Epshteyn commentaries it would require its stations to air from three per week to nine, and added  interviews  with pro-Trump politicos in Washington. These are centrally-produced conservative editorials that, among other things, call mainstream coverage of events  fake news  and put out scaremongering  terrorism alerts,  which managers at Sinclair-owned stations are required to work into their broadcast schedules.Are you picking up what I m throwing down yet? This is straight-up state propaganda television, like you might see in Russia or China.If you don t think it can affect you with a paltry number like 223 total stations, consider this. One such station is my local ABC affiliate, KOMO. At 64 years old, the station is now owned since 2013 by Sinclair. Prior to its sale, KOMO was the last major locally-owned television station in the Seattle area. KOMO absolutely dominates viewership for both morning and mid-day news, and is the local station that carries the Emmy Awards. The complaints of reporters at the station that the  must-run  segments they were being forced to air looked like real news (and therefore made them look like they were endorsing it) fell on deaf ears.The stations themselves don t want this, and they can t stop it.Trump is creating a network of stations that promote him and his agenda, all while decrying anything Americans are used to as  fake news.

1,Fake,"August 6, 2017",News,"Maybe you ve finally heard by now that a mosque in Bloomington, Minnesota was bombed early Saturday morning. Maybe. It seemed confusing as it was being reported, because nobody was calling it what it actually was: an act of terrorism aimed at a church. In fact, you were hard-pressed to find anyone even calling it a hate crime, despite the fact that it clearly was. Everything about the incident added up to exactly what America would have called a terrorist attack   if it had been committed by Muslims, instead of against them.In the New York Times report, details included the fact that congregants has just begun to gather for morning prayers, the fact that the bomb was thrown into the Imam s (pastor s) room, and the fact that one worshiper ran outside at the sound of the explosion just in time to see a truck speeding out of the parking lot. Just everything you might need for a terrorist attack: maximum presence, a specific target, and a fleeing suspect.When news hit the wire that it was carried out with an improvised explosive device   an IED, in the parlance of Middle East wars   you d think that would draw some response from the President of the United States. A terrorist attack on a church, using a weapon you might find in the desert of Iraq. Condemnation from every Republican in Washington, right?Not so much.Apparently there was a terrorist bombing in Minnesota today.

You probably didn't hear about this because mainstream media likes to demonize Muslims.  Brown Saraah (@Brown_Saraah) August 6, 2017It took until Sunday before someone finally called it a terrorist attack, and it was Minnesota s own Democratic governor, Mark Dayton, who used the appropriate language. He visited the Dar al Farooq mosque with a cadre of other public officials, and was devastated by the sight:What a terrible, dastardly, cowardly act was committed. It is a criminal act of terrorism.But Muslims across the country surely know that Trump s silence on the issue is quite purposeful. He s made it very clear that his aim since before he even secured the Republican nomination was to curtail Muslim entry into the US, to marginalize them and monitor them as though their very presence were terrorism in itself. Every attack inside the US that is perpetrated by a Muslim, whether it is related to religion, hate crimes, or simply random, is immediately branded terrorism. But crimes against them are never looked at in the same light.We must support our Muslim brothers and sisters across this country, and never allow them to be marginalized the way Trump and his fellow Republicans want them to be. If we don t hold the terrorist responsible for this attack to the same account we would demand of a Muslim attacker, we are no better than the Trump fans across the country who were no doubt secretly glad that it happened.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images", It Took A Democratic Governor To Finally Call The Mosque Bombing Terrorism

Even as it s clear to everyone else that lawmakers must move on and focus on other things, Trump is threatening to withhold ACA payments from insurance companies. However, Trump has just been handed a devastating blow as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell makes moves toward a bipartisan approach to health care.This is seriously the last thing Trump wants, but it s happening and the GOP doesn t care how Trump feels about it. According to CBS News: A week after an attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act failed, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he d consider a bipartisan effort to continue payments to insurers to avert a costly rattling of health insurance markets.McConnell told reporters Saturday there is  still a chance  the Senate could revive the measure to repeal and replace  Obamacare,  but he acknowledged the window for that is rapidly closing. Everyone knows that the Obamacare repeal is hopeless. Americans are strongly against it, and nothing the Republican Party has put forward over the last few months has even been close to an alternative. Republicans are slowly becoming aware that a bipartisan bill might be their only chance to have some sort of impact on health care   and if Congress approves a bipartisan bill with enough support to override a presidential veto, Trump will be forced to sign the bill whether he likes it or not.Trump s presidency looks more and more like a failure every single day.

Gore has been on a speaking tour in support of his new movie An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power, the follow-up to his Oscar-winning 2006 documentary An Inconvenient Truth. His visit on the late night show culminated with a discussion of our elections and what Democrats can do to get back to winning.But Bill got directly into the subject of the movie, asking Al whether we were  kidding ourselves  about being able to turn the tide on climate change. He cited multiple predictions of a  tipping point  beyond which there would be no return. Gore emphasized that different people meant different things by the phrase, but that scientists still agree we have not yet reached a point where it s completely out of our control. But he did say that some tipping points have in fact been reached with lost ice sheets and rising sea levels, and said that America was still in danger of exacerbating the problem. We could lose Venice. We could lose Florida,  Maher remarked, before adding,  and who would know better about losing Florida? Without missing a beat, Gore responded,  Actually, I think I carried Florida. The conversation naturally turned to current events and Donald Trump, with Maher mentioning Trump s promise to bring back coal jobs, and Gore reminding him that it was coal companies, not climate change activists, who got rid of most of those jobs. When Trump pulled out of the Paris Accord, Gore said, he was concerned that it would serve as an excuse for other countries to do the same   but the rest of the world  redoubled their commitment  the next day.Then Bill brought up something Gore has said many times: That if we re going to fix the climate, we have to  fix our democracy first.  Recalling the gaps between popular vote and actual outcomes in 2000 and 2016, Maher lamented the direction of the trend. When he asked Gore,  How do we fix that,  Gore was succinct:Well, I do think it s time to get rid of the electoral college and go to a popular vote for president But even more importantly than that, we have to get big money out of politics. The lobbyists and the fat-cat contributors hacked our democracy before Putin hacked our democracy, and we need to defend it and put the people back in control   and we can do that.Gore couldn t be more right. Whether it s through a constitutional amendment, or the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, America should be represented at the highest level by the person most people want in charge.

Before that, though, she worked for the FBI. On Saturday, she had a warning for Trump, and hopeful news for the American people. First, she talked about disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, and the Mueller team s request that the White House hand over all documents relating to Flynn s short and troubled time in the White House: They probably honed in on a crime or some set of crimes that they want to get more information on. They re probably looking for any kind of communications. Of course, this is likely related to foreign payments that Flynn received but did not immediately disclose. Then, Rangappa went on to say that the grand jury is definitely bad news for Trump and the people in his orbit: The new grand jury is an indication that this is expanding. This is probably still in the early stages. It would be normal at this point to collect more evidence, so they want possibly financial records, they want people to come in and testify under oath to get more information and they re going to use that to proceed. So this is going to be one stage of many as I explained to some people, if this were a TV drama, this might be Episode 4. So, stay tuned. There s more coming.

They also knew he was unfit to be president, yet they got him elected anyway, because they felt they had no choice. However, seven months into this disastrous excuse for a  presidency,  it seems that the GOP is coming to realize that Trump was a huge mistake. Therefore it should come as no surprise that there are already shadow campaigns from several high profile Republicans   including Trump s second-in-command, Mike Pence   underway for the 2020 presidential race.The New York Times reports that Mike Pence, Ben Sasse and John Kasich appear to be secretly lobbying GOP donors in order to unseat Trump should he last his full four-year term. Of course, the White House is pushing back against these reports. Spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said of these efforts: The president is as strong as he s ever been in Iowa, and every potentially ambitious Republican knows that. However, according the the New York Times, donors, elected officials throughout the Republican Party, and conservative groups are all saying that they don t even know if Trump will be able to run in 2020, and there is definitely support for a primary challenger to Trump. Of course, many of these people are not willing to publicly criticize a president from their own party, but others are. For instance, John McCain spoke for them, saying that many see Trump as weak.Of course, both Ben Sasse and John Kasich have been openly critical of Trump, which has helped both of their public profiles to rise. Further, it s pretty obvious that Pence took the job as the second man on the Trump ticket thinking that Trump would not last in the White House. Hell, Maxine Waters even came out and said that Pence is planning his inauguration.In short, the GOP s bigoted base stuck them   and the nation   with Trump.

They re also renaming a large chunk of I-55, running from just southwest of the city of Chicago to near Bloomington-Normal, in the center of the state. That will become the  Barack Obama Presidential Expressway. That may well rankle Donald Trump and his supporters, who insist that Obama was the worst thing ever to happen to this country.

If there s any POTUS that doesn t deserve to take time off, it s certainly #45.Trump has gotten a lot of backlash over taking time off, especially considering how much Trump criticized former president Barack Obama for taking a little bit of time off.

Specifically, one of his biggest jobs, in his view, is controlling Trump s Twitter habit.Trump uses his Twitter account to tweet everything from childish temper tantrums over the Russia probe and  fake news,  to lying in order to appear totally great and awesome and like he s the best person ever to walk the Earth, to creating actual policy. The most recent example of his problems with creating policy on social media is when he tried to reinstate the military s ban on transgender people serving via Twitter, catching the Pentagon off-guard despite his lie that he d come to that decision after heavy consultation with his military generals. In fact, lawyers from the Department of Defense had repeatedly tried to warn him off that ban while they worked on the best way to do things. Apparently, he was impatient and thought he would force the DoD to work faster if he just came out with it.He s also insulted our allies and made blatantly false accusations on Twitter. Despite that, Sean Spicer said back in early June that Trump s tweets are official White House statements. Some say that Trump is blurring the lines between opinion and policy whether he s making official statements or not.And this is what General Kelly sees as his biggest job   reining this kind of behavior, or at least  pushing his tweets in the right direction,  as it was put to Politico. Kelly has given up on trying to keep Trump off of Twitter entirely, but he does believe he should work to keep Trump from using Twitter like a spoiled rotten toddler who s mad that he s not getting his way on everything.In other words, his biggest job is taking on the role of parent or babysitter working to limit what a poorly-behaved child can do. And he s taking on this role for a 71-year old man-baby.Kelly wants to know what Trump is going to tweet before he tweets it.

Also, McCain is often openly critical of Trump, and he was the final GOP Senator to sink the so-called  skinny repeal  of the Affordable Care Act. To put it delicately, there is no love lost between the two men.Now, it seems that McCain, who is battling brain cancer is really speaking his mind, no matter who would criticize him for doing so. This time, his target is to expose the real feelings of Capitol Hill Republicans when it comes to Donald Trump. McCain said in an interview to The New York Times regarding Trump s reelection chances: They see weakness in this president. Look, it s not a nice business we re in. McCain then went on to rip the chaos of the Trump White House, and particularly the effect their incompetence is having on national security: I urge the President to resolve the differences within his administration as soon as possible and decide on a policy and strategy that can achieve our national security interests in Afghanistan and the region. The thing is, traditional Republicans never wanted Donald Trump to be their nominee or their president. They knew, like anyone else watching, that he was woefully unfit to be president of the United States. However, instead of putting their country before their party, they propped Trump up anyway, and their fear of his voters will not allow them to speak out, or to do anything about him.However, John McCain is such a towering, respected figure in the United States Senate that it s clear he just doesn t give a damn.

But even if Trump does avoid those scenarios, he cannot avoid the wrath of voters in 2020.And it turns out that Trump s own voter base is turning against him.During the 2016 Election, 66 percent of white voters without a college degree voted for Trump, which speaks volumes about the importance of a good education.In June, 53 percent of those voters still supported Trump and approved of his job performance.The latest Quinnipiac poll, however, has bad news for Trump and the Republican Party.Trump s support among white voters without a college degree has slipped to under 50 percent.Indeed, only 43 percent now approve of the way he is doing his job. And his numbers are cratering among white men and women. Right now, 47 percent of white men still approve of Trump, but that s down from the 62 percent who voted for him. Trump s number among white women are even worse as a whopping 64 percent disapprove of him.In a statement about the poll numbers, assistant director of the Quinnipiac poll had a laundry list of reasons why Trump s numbers have fallen through the floor. It s hard to pick what is the most alarming number in the troubling trail of new lows for President Donald Trump. Profound embarrassment over his performance in office and deepening concern over his level-headedness have to raise the biggest red flags. The daily drip drip of missteps and firings and discord are generating a tidal wave of bad polling numbers. Overall, the poll showed that only 33 percent of Americans approve of Trump while 61 percent disapprove.This is a disaster for Republicans that will only get worse as long as Trump remains in office. And it s unlikely that Republicans will keep Trump off the ballot in 2020 because they don t want to anger the extremists in their party. And that could have a down-ballot effect that really comes down like a sledgehammer on the GOP. If Republicans don t lose the Senate and House in 2018, they almost certainly will in 2020 with a VERY unpopular Trump on the ballot.It s also a major blow to Trump s fragile ego.

Then earlier this year, Bill O Reilly, the detestable prime time face of Fox News, was  vacationed  until it was no longer tenable and they had to cut ties. The president of their sports division, Jamie Horowitz, struck out next, getting sacked early in July.Now Fox is dealing with the fallout of another explosive accusation, this time against insufferable asshat and The Five host Eric Bolling.Late Friday, the Huffington Post reported they had confirmation from two undisclosed current and former co-stars of Bolling s that the noted bigot and conspiracy theorist had sent them unsolicited pictures of his genitals. I use the clinical term for fear I might accidentally imagine what Bolling s little  breaking news  might look like.Unfortunately for the minor celebrity, his junk is apparently as famous as he is: According to the HuffPo piece, the recipients of the photos shared them with at least four other people, and conversation about the photos   which can be just as descriptive   reached the ears of more than a dozen. In all, HuffPo spoke to 14 people about the allegations, and everybody s story matched.Maybe Eric s got a freckle or something.A spokesman for Fox deflected, saying  We were just informed of this and plan to investigate the matter. As for Bolling himself, he has been silent. But his lawyer was quick with the standard denial boilerplate:Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made.Bolling s exclusive interview with Donald Trump at the start of his newest show The Specialists may have  rubbed  off on Eric in just the kind of way you d image when two lecherous piles of garbage like that get together.

On Friday, Trump s moronic action of the day was to break the law. Again. This time, with his Twitter account.Trump just couldn t wait to jump onto his favorite social media platform and brag about his great jobs report   not even for one measly hour to comply with the law.

According to a federal rule, executive branch officials have to wait one hour after this type of information is released before publicly commenting on it. The specific rule, the Office of Management and Budget s Statistical Policy Directive No. 3, has been in place since 1985 and states: Except for members of the staff of the agency issuing the principal economic indicator who have been designated by the agency head to provide technical explanations of the data, employees of the Executive Branch shall not comment publicly on the data until at least one hour after the official release time. Well, okay. Trump s a dumbass. We all know this. You can tell from his vocabulary that he isn t the brightest crayon in the box. So, maybe he just didn t know that he was supposed to keep his big mouth shut for a whopping 60 minutes? Yeah, well, no. He knew. We know he knew because his administration has gotten themselves in trouble before for breaking this very same rule in the very same way.Back in March, Sean Spicer was too excited to wait that hour when the February jobs report was released and couldn t stop himself from tweeting about it after only 22 minutes.Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump  Sarah Sanders (@PressSec) March 10, 2017And everybody cried foul when this happened five months ago, so it isn t like no one ever told them about this rule.

1,Fake,"August 4, 2017",News,"First, he impaneled a grand jury. Then the grand jury began issuing subpoenas. Now, investigators working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller have issued an official request for White House documents pertaining to the Russia investigation. Specifically, they re looking for things related to Michael Flynn, Russia, and Turkey. The requests aren t subpoenas, but they could become subpoenas if the White House refuses to hand them over.Investigators are interested in payments that Flynn received for speeches given to Russian companies. Flynn s financial disclosure forms initially didn t include the payments from the Russian companies, and he had to file an amended version with those payments later on.Gee, it almost looks like he tried to hide his contacts with anyone Russian, just like Jared Kushner and Jeff Sessions.But Mueller s team is also looking into Trump s own financial ties with Russia, and other possible financial crimes on Trump s part, too. Trump tried to intimidate Mueller on that front, warning him not to go that far and to keep the investigation s focus on Russian collusion. Mueller has, more or less, told Trump to go screw himself. Trump s outside counsel says that they ll resist anything from Mueller s office that goes beyond the  mandate specified in the appointment. Oh, please. That positively reeks of fear. It s also further evidence that the Trump administration doesn t believe that the Department of Justice or any agency within it should be independent of the White House.The FBI is also interested in a $530,000 payment made to the Flynn Intel Group for work on discrediting an opponent of the Turkish government. They re looking to see if the Turkish government was behind those payments, or if it really was a private deal between Flynn s company and a Turkish American businessman. They ve begun questioning people on this very thing, too.It s not illegal to be paid by foreign governments. It is illegal to fail to register as a foreign agent while taking those payments. Flynn s registration as a foreign agent only happened after his company s work with Turkey was revealed.The fear is there and it s real.

Dana Loesch has transformed herself from useful Fox News idiot to darling of the Second Amendment, and the NRA is more than happy to put her stern but beautiful face on camera.Earlier this year, Loesch and the NRA put out a video recruiting ad they called  The Clenched Fist of Truth.  It accused the left of  assassinating real news  and using wedge issues like homophobia, racism, and sexism to stifle the views of conservative Americans. In the video, schoolchildren are depicted on a playground just before Loesch says they re being indoctrinated to believe Trump is  another Hitler.  In short, it s disgusting.

Loesch carefully phrases her threats as a shot across the  proverbial  bow of the Times, so as to avoid being accused of outright incitement. But the accusations in the video mirror perfectly the paranoia, suspicion, and resentment of Trump fans who want to believe that news they don t like is  fake.  And the final phrase in the video    We re coming for you    is as menacing as anything else the NRA has done.In a near-derailing of the conversation, a few pundits misheard Loesch s use of the word Fisk (a  verb-ing  of the last name of a writer considered easily debunked by right-wingers who disagree with him), thinking instead that she had said  fist.  If that seems like a silly thing to get hung up on, the context clears it up:We re going to fisk the New York Times and find out just what deep rich means to this old gray hag.If you thought that said  fist,  the meaning is changed considerably. Their mistake wasn t just one of hearing, though   the tweet from the NRA accompanying the video uses the hashtag #ClenchedFistOfTruth. The mistake is understandable. Loesch didn t think so: She blew up at a few notable tweeters who made the error.The new, Orwellian video says, in part:We ve had it with your constant protection of your Democrat overlords, your refusal to acknowledge any truth that upsets the fragile construct that you believe is real life.Somebody is confused about what s real and what s not   and it s not the New York Times.Watch the video here:.@DLoesch has a message for the @nytimes:  We're coming for you.

Not the majority of Americans who voted against him, not a good portion of regretful Trump voters, and not even the members of the party that helped get him elected so he could push their agenda forward. That s right   Trump has become a joke to many members of the Republican Party now, and he knows it. In fact, he s throwing a tantrum trying to get their attention. But no matter what he does now, it s not working. He s lost them for good.Trump has recently resorted to making threats to Republican lawmakers to try and show them who is boss, but they aren t afraid of him anymore. Now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russia is closing in on Trump, the GOP is actually ignoring him more than they are listening, according to a report by Vanity Fair.On Thursday, Mueller decided to impanel a grand jury for Trump s Russia investigation, signaling to many Republicans that they needed to act quickly to prevent Trump from sabotaging the effort. Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) told the Washington Post: The Mueller situation really gave rise to our thinking about how we can address this, address the current situation. With Mueller targeting Trump and now that healthcare is off the table after many failures (even though Trump is still demanding that GOPers work on legislation), Republicans are moving on. Vanity Fair reported: Republicans used to be afraid of Trump. Now, they re mostly ignoring him. The administration s ham-handed attempts to coerce Senators Dean Heller and Lisa Murkowski to vote  yes  on Obamacare repeal were met with sharp criticism from Republican lawmakers. And Trump s threats in the aftermath of the failed health-care vote last week fell on deaf ears. Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) was also cited for his comments about Trump s bullying to Republican lawmakers over the healthcare debacle. Corker said: If that s what he wants to do, he ought to just do it. [As] probably he s learned over the last couple of weeks, threats don t really go over particularly well. My advice would be to either do it or don t do it.

Nonetheless, Donald Trump continues to talk about the wall, but one Republican Congressman, Rep Francis Rooney (R-FL) finally broke down and told the truth today. Trump was lying to his supporters. I think it s another bit of campaign rhetoric,  Rooney said on CNN Thursday.  It s highly unusual, but I don t think that anyone during the campaign seriously thought that Mexico would pay for that wall even though we all desperately believe the wall s a metaphor for border security.

Nixon resigned before he could be impeached and was subsequently pardoned by Geral Ford. Clinton s impeachment trial ended in his favor, so Ken Starr abandoned the indictment effort.Trump, however, is not being impeached at the moment because Republicans still refuse to do their constitutional duty. So the next best thing is a criminal indictment, which could be slapped against Trump or any member of his family if the grand jury sees fit to do so.That s going to depend on the evidence, of which there is plenty thanks to Donald Trump Jr., who released emails confirming that Trump s campaign colluded with Russia during the 2016 Election.Fox News host Jeanine Pirro all but directly threatened bloody violence if the grandy jury indicts Trump or any member of his family, even if the evidence proves one or all of them broke the law.

Here is my concern.

Indeed, grand juries have failed to indict in clear cases where police officers murdered unarmed black men. Just look at the Eric Garner case for example. Garner was strangled to death just for allegedly selling cigarettes. The grand jury in that case decided not to indict the officer who killed him even though Garner s death was ruled a homicide.The evidence was clear. Garner s death was even caught on film. It should have been enough to send the police officer to prison. Instead, the grand jury chose to indict the man who filmed Garner s murder.Clearly, Pirro is wrong about grand juries.Pirro is also wrong to incite an  uprising  just because the walls of justice are closing in on Trump and his crime family. This amounts to a threat against the grand jury, which could be seen as interference. Pirro is literally telling the grand jury to absolve Trump or face possible violent retribution. That s unacceptable and Robert Mueller should question Pirro for it.She may be a former judge and prosecutor, but tampering with a grand jury in this way is still a crime she could be punished for.Featured Image: Screenshot", WATCH: Fox Host Calls For Revolt If Grand Jury Indicts Trump
1,Fake,"August 4, 2017",News,"Ever since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff Sessions from the investigation into Russia s meddling in the 2016 presidential election and the subsequent appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, Donald Trump has been attempting to find a way to get rid of Mueller and shut down the investigation. Since he doesn t have the power to fire Mueller directly, Trump has been gunning for a way to have an Attorney General installed who will do his bidding. It is the reason for his constant public humiliation of Sessions, and for his constantly calling the entire probe into his campaign s possible collusion with Russia a  witch hunt  and a  hoax.  Well, it seems that the United States Senate has had enough.Senators have been worried that Trump would fire Sessions and appoint a loyal toady in his place during the August recess without Senate confirmation. Therefore, they have decided to hold what are called pro-forma sessions during the recess to handcuff Trump s ability to appoint anyone to any positions without the approval of the majority of the United States Senate. These sessions are nothing more than having a member of the majority to preside briefly every three days during the recess, so that the Senate is technically in session. This keeps Trump from being able to do anything regarding whatever loyalists he may appoint to whatever position.This all comes on the heels of Special Counsel Mueller impaneling a grand jury with regards to the Russia investigation. Trump can t be happy, and will likely begin attacking Senators on Twitter once he learns what has just happened to his plans to fire Mueller before anyone around him can be indicted.This action on the part of the Senate should come as no surprise, though, as Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley has already warned Trump that he will absolutely not confirm a new Attorney General if Trump decides to fire Sessions.What s next, pre-emptive pardons?

Here s Trump announcing his merit-based system, called the RAISE Act:I campaigned on creating a merit-based immigration system that protects U.S. workers & taxpayers. Watch: https://t.co/lv3ScSKnF6 #RAISEAct pic.twitter.com/zCFK5OfYnB  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 2, 2017Since Trump announced the RAISE Act on Tuesday, it has been opposed by several Democratic lawmakers and several Republicans like Graham. These lawmakers are arguing that Trump s proposed plan puts the service industry  in peril.  Graham explained: South Carolina s number one industry is agriculture and tourism is number two. If this proposal were to become law, it would be devastating to our state s economy which relies on this immigrant workforce. South Carolina s agriculture and tourism industry advertise for American workers and want to fill open positions with American workers. Unfortunately, many of these advertised positions go unfilled. Hotels, restaurants, golf courses and farmers will tell you this proposal to cut legal immigration in half would put their business in peril. Another South Carolina Republican, Tim Scott, also opposed Trump s plans. Scott stated that America needed to fix  our broken illegal immigration problem  but also wanted the country  to encourage the legal process  due to its positive effects on the labor force. Senate Republican Conference Chairman John Thune had similar concerns about the labor workforce. He said: If we get on immigration, there will be a lot of different perspectives on that  We have workforce needs, and some of those are filled by the immigrant labor supply. Unfortunately, this is likely going to fall on deaf ears, considering that the current POTUS was ignorant enough to say in his campaign announcement, When Mexico sends its people, they aren t sending their best.  Trump has been anti-immigration from the start, and he clearly doesn t care if the way he goes about it sucks.Featured image is a screenshot"," Top Republicans TRASH Trump’s Immigration Proposal, GOP In Pieces (TWEET)"
1,Fake,"August 3, 2017",News,"The roll out of the first version of Donald Trump s bigoted Muslim ban was nothing short of chaotic. People were arriving in America, only to be turned around and sent back, or detained. Even green card holders were stopped at ports of entry into the nation. There were even photos of children and elderly and disabled people being handcuffed. It was one of the most horrifically un-American moments in this nation s history. Now, new reporting from the Daily Beast shows that that Trump administration s plans regarding the implementation of this ban were even more sinister.It seems that this was the first trial balloon for Trump s intention to bypass a co-equal branch of government, as his people at the ports of entry were told to ignore judges and members of Congress trying to cut past the chaos created by Trump. Instead of letting these people do their jobs, Border Patrol agents were told to ignore them. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) says of these revelations: I m extremely troubled that CBP [Customs and Border Protection] employees would be instructed by superiors to ignore Congressional representatives trying to do their job, especially under such circumstances. We suspected as much at the time, but it s jarring to see it in black and white. I ll be seeking more information from CBP on this matter. These disturbing developments come via a leaked email from Todd Owen, of the Customs and Border Patrol Commission said to his people at the ports of entry: As stated on the call earlier today, you and your staff are NOT to engage with the media or Congressional representatives at this time. Please make sure your subordinate Port Directors are following this direction. Please report any such requests to acting AC[REDACTED] from Congressional Affairs. Thank you. Further, the Border Patrol agents were explicitly told to be suspicious of attorneys attempting to help   in other words, this is why people were denied counsel in such a brazenly unconstitutional way.If this doesn t tell you how little respect this autocratic administration has for our form of government and way of living, I don t know what will.

1,Fake,"August 3, 2017",News,"The  deal-maker  just got owned.Donald Trump embarrassed himself and America again during a recent phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.As we all know, President Obama struck a deal with Australia in 2015 agreeing to take 2,000 refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea s Manus Island.But Trump doesn t want to honor the deal, so he whined about it. I hate taking these people,  Trump said.  I guarantee you they are bad. That is why they are in prison right now. They are not going to be wonderful people who go on to work for the local milk people. The refugees are in a detention camp right now because they have been denied entry into Australia. They are not necessarily  bad  people.Trump s  milk people  remark is a reference to the American dairy industry.It s a racist remark, of course. Because not all immigrants perform farm work. Some become doctors and businessmen. Some become teachers and police officers. Some even go into politics.The fact is that United States can also hold these refugees until a thorough vetting process is complete before allowing them to resettle. Therefore, Trump s concern that these refugees are  bad  is ridiculous.Anyway, Turnbull, who is also a businessman, told Trump to suck it up and honor the terms of the agreement. There is nothing more important in business or politics than a deal is a deal,  Turnbull reminded Trump.  You can certainly say that it was not a deal that you would have done, but you are going to stick with it. In other words, the man who allegedly wrote  The Art of The Deal  just got schooled on deal-making by Australia s prime minister.Turnbull is right. A deal is a deal and Trump must comply with it or risk angering and alienating one of our closest allies.Trump cannot just go back and examine every deal made in American history and go back on it if he doesn t agree with it. That s not how governing works. Sitting presidents must honor the agreements made by their predecessors. Anything else violates trust between nations and hurts our reputation around the globe.He can try to renegotiate a deal if he wishes and some deals can even be voided by Congress. But the deal with Australia will be hard to renegotiate because Turnbull expects America to honor it.And we should.

1,Fake,"August 2, 2017",News,"Donald Trump finally signed the Countering America s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act on Wednesday.  This bill strengthens and expands sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The legislation also blocks Trump from easing those sanctions for his good buddy Vladimir Putin.Some questioned if Trump would try to use his veto power even though the bill had passed both the House and Senate with overwhelming support. Such an effort would have been futile, as there was clearly enough support to override the veto. But still, it was a possibility since nothing is ever off the table with this administration. And as time drug on (the bill landed on Trump s desk Friday morning), we all began to wonder if Trump was actually going to sign it.When he finally did, Senator John McCain had a brutal response that was absolutely perfect. He started by explaining what this legislation would accomplish. I welcome President Trump s decision to sign legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia, Iran, and North Korea. The enactment of this legislation, which enjoyed overwhelming bipartisan support in both houses of Congress, sends a strong message to friend and foe alike that the United States will hold nations accountable for aggressive and destabilizing behavior that threatens our national interests and those of our allies and partners,  McCain wrote. The concerns expressed in the President s signing statement are hardly surprising, though misplaced. The Framers of our Constitution made the Congress and the President coequal branches of government. This bill has already proven the wisdom of that choice. Then McCain called Trump out for his continued hypocritical support of Russia. While the American people surely hope for better relations with Russia, what this legislation truly represents is their insistence that Vladimir Putin and his regime must pay a real price for attacking our democracy, violating human rights, occupying Crimea, and destabilizing Ukraine. On this critical issue of national security policy, it was the Congress that acted in the spirit of national unity to carry out the will of the American people. And that is why it is critical that the President comply with the letter and spirit of this legislation and fully implement all of its provisions. Going forward, I hope the President will be as vocal about Russia s aggressive behavior as he was about his concerns with this legislation. Boom!Sorry McCain, but I wouldn t count on Trump to stand up to Putin any time soon. Our  president  has proven time and time again that he will happily choose Russia over the United States and the American people. Trump s admiration for the Russian dictator and his murderous rule is as obvious as it is nauseating. Personally, I don t think that is likely to change.

Now, in just a few short months, the country has become a global laughingstock and Trump only continues to pour salt in the wound each day.Most Americans   especially the majority that voted against him   are embarrassed beyond belief to witness what is happening in Congress and in the Trump administration. However, the actual data might surprise some. Thanks to a poll by Quinnipiac University, we now know just how bad Americans are suffering under our new undeserving president. The poll reported: American voters say 54   26 percent that they are embarrassed rather than proud to have Trump as president. Voters say 57   40 percent he is abusing the powers of his office and say 60   36 percent that he believes he is above the law. The hilarious thing is that Trump is already running his reelection campaign for 2020   because he believes he actually has a chance! If America is currently THIS disappointed in Trump s performance, we can only imagine how eager the country will be to kick Trump out of the White House if he lasts his full term!These results show that more than ever, Trump is a national embarrassment. Trump is historically unpopular   not even former presidents Barack Obama and George W. Bush were considered to be a humiliation by voters.No one can take Trump seriously as the leader of the free world, and no one has any respect for him   and because of that, Trump has no real power. The entire country is fed up with his childish antics and the way he has disgraced America s reputation. Not even members of his own party will help him get things done!

The Office of Special Counsel has secured the services of Greg Andres, a former Justice Department lawyer specializing in foreign bribery and fraud. He began work on Tuesday, becoming the 16th lawyer on Mueller s now all-star team. Bribery, of course, is a much easier charge to prove than intentional collusion, and having a specialist may indicate Mueller is exploring the possibility of taking down Trump using whatever methods are available to him and most effective.It s easy to lose hope these days. From sunup to sundown, we are treated to some of the worst examples of corruption, greed, and incompetence America has ever known, and it s all coming from an administration we know is illegitimate. And without the kind of leaks that helped derail the Clinton campaign   which must have overjoyed Trump fans every time they happened   there doesn t seem to be much news on just when we can expect some justice. So don t be too disappointed when I tell you: This is the way it should be.That s right. In a proper investigation, the public knows almost nothing about the internal proceedings, and it s with good reason. Because James Comey flipped on the Trump administration, we forget that in the beginning, he was the guy giving traction to unfounded stories about Clinton s emails. If that had been a real case, Comey himself would have ruined it with his careless premature releases   it would have fallen apart.Mueller is too smart to be that reckless. By limiting what the public knows other than the occasional tidbit about a new person of interest, an alternative angle at the president s financials, or something new happening within his office, Mueller can rest assured that no improper access to evidence can spoil his case.Believe me, when this all goes down, we want it to go down for good.In the meantime, we can enjoy the fact that we now know Mueller has Andres on the team.

Once the son says something in a public statement he d be very likely to say something to the special prosecutor, and lying to the special prosecutor is a crime.

During his temper tantrum, he also made some very unfortunate comments about Steve Bannon s  c*ck.

She has proven time and time again that she is loyal to Trump   and that she has no problem lying to the press about anything and everything. This also happens to be the reason that she has absolutely no credibility.Way back in February, Morning Joe s Mika Brzenski said that she refused to have Conway appear on the show because she is the epitome of  fake news. So, Joe was just saying that she books herself on these shows. We know for a fact she tries to book herself on this show. I won t do it because I don t believe in fake news or information that is not true.

The story is beyond cruel in that the family of Seth Rich had specifically called for an end to the false stories circulated by Fox News, but now Trump is caught in the middle, too.Rod Wheeler, a longtime paid commentator for the news network, claims that Fox News and the Trump supporter, Ed Butowsky, intended to deflect public attention from the administration s Russia scandal. His suit further states that a Fox News reporter created quotations out of thin air and attributed them to him in order to propel her story.NPR reports:On April 20, a month before the story ran, Butowsky and Wheeler   the investor and the investigator   met at the White House with then-press secretary Sean Spicer to brief him on what they were uncovering.The first page of the lawsuit quotes a voicemail and text from Butowsky boasting that Trump himself had reviewed drafts of the Fox News story just before it went to air and was published.Here it is:The White House previously denied knowledge of Fox News' false report on Seth Rich. pic.twitter.com/Qcmf3lpaFt  Adrienne Watson (@Adrienne_DNC) August 1, 2017The DNC did not murder Seth Rich but Trump supporters would need to have the ability to Google in order to understand that it s a hoax.As a surprise to no one ever, the White House previously denied any knowledge of the Fox News  lie about the false story about Seth Rich s murder.The White House previously denied knowledge of Fox News' false report on Seth Rich. pic.twitter.com/Qcmf3lpaFt  Adrienne Watson (@Adrienne_DNC) August 1, 2017Seth Rich s family released a statement.Statement from the Seth Rich family pic.twitter.com/p7siiOIYKh  Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) August 1, 2017Russia propaganda site Sputnik pushed the story, too.It wasn't just Butowsky who wanted this false story pushed.

That problem is giving them serious legal problems that do not have to be when it comes to Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into the Trump campaign s possible collusion with the Russians to try and fix the 2016 election.First, they said there were not meetings with Russians. Then, we find out that Donald Trump Jr., former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort, and Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with a shady Russian lawyer, along with other people tied to the Russian government. After that, Trump Jr. came out with a statement saying that they were talking about Russian adoptions and nothing else. Then, that statement fell apart when it turns out that they went into that meeting thinking they were going to get dirt on then-Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton from the Russian government. Now, it turns out that while the lawyers wanted to be truthful in Trump Jr. s statement, Donald Trump decided he wanted to lie for his son, and personally put together the statement.Trump s advisers are furious. One said, on condition of anonymity, to the Washington Post: This was . . . unnecessary. Now someone can claim he s the one who attempted to mislead. Somebody can argue the president is saying he doesn t want you to say the whole truth. The adviser then went on to suggest that Trump doesn t fully understand that he and his people are in serious legal trouble over the Russia investigation: He refuses to sit still. He doesn t think he s in any legal jeopardy, so he really views this as a political problem he is going to solve by himself. A lawyer who investigated President George W. Bush regarding the unmasking of CIA Agent Valerie Plame, Peter Zeidenberg, says of the bumbling attempt at a cover-up by Team Trump: The thing that really strikes me about this is the stupidity of involving the president. They are still treating this like a family-run business and they have a PR problem. . . . What they don t seem to understand is this is a criminal investigation involving all of them. Well, hopefully, they continue to screw up in their responses to this. There s definitely wrongdoing here. Perhaps Robert Mueller already has the smoking gun, and wants to make sure the case is airtight before they are all indicted and hauled off to jail where belong.

During his report, Zeleny said Scaramucci was  essentially escorted off the White House property earlier this afternoon. Source: MediaiteWhile it may not be that unusual for an ex-employee to be escorted out of the White House, it s safe to say that during Scaramucci s turbulent and tiny tenure, he didn t make any friends.

Even Donald Trump, who has mocked disabled people and Gold Star families, who goes on Twitter tirades against anyone who stands in his way and who is completely fascinated with women bleeding, thought Scaramucci s language was  inappropriate.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017As usual, Trump is lying his ass off.The truth is that members of Congress must buy health insurance through the exchanges like the rest of us and they don t get a special subsidy either. They pay what the rest of us do.According to FactCheck.org,  lawmakers and their staffs face additional requirements that other Americans don t,  and the  subsidy  which Trump appears to be referring to is just a contribution from the federal government. Lawmakers are merely getting a contribution from their employer like ordinary Americans who get insurance through their employer. Except lawmakers are not getting insurance through their employer like they used to. Members of Congress used to get their healthcare paid for by the taxpayer. That ended under Obamacare as lawmakers were forced to buy a private plan through the exchanges like everyone else. In other words, Congress pays what we pay.And then Trump once again took credit for President Obama s economy.Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017By the end of President Obama s tenure, and long before Trump was elected, the stock market had already reached record highs. Unemployment fell to under 5 percent thanks to Obama s record 75 consecutive months of job growth. Wages also rose by 2.9 percent. Wages under Trump have actually remained flat no matter how much he wants to take credit for imaginary wage hikes. The border was also secure under Obama as illegal immigration dropped significantly under his watch. And if Trump really thinks his White House isn t chaotic he is truly delusional.The bottom line is that Trump is trying to take credit for things President Obama did while trying to erase his legacy. Trump won t have a legacy, so he is trying to steal Obama s for himself. It s just more desperation from a pathetic man who is unfit to be president, but a perfect fit for federal prison.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Trump Whines About Obamacare And Takes Credit For Obama’s Economy In Delusional Morning Rant

People such as Tomi Lahren.The pair struggled to find any common ground during the first several minutes of the interview and then the topic turned to healthcare. When Handler asked Lahren if she had health insurance, she replied,  Luckily, I am 24, so I am still on my parents  plan  a line that drew loud boos from the crowd, but Handler still defended her by telling the audience to stop, she is being honest.  Despite Handler taking the high road, Lahren went on to say that Obamacare is in a  death spiral. Being able to stay on your parents  plan until the age of 26 is a major aspect of the current healthcare legislation and also one of the beneficial facets that critics of the Affordable Care Act tend to overlook, instead opting to chastise other factors such as the individual mandate to buy insurance.The outspoken Lahren has been a controversial figure in the realm of political commentary, having joined the pro-Donald Trump group Great American Alliance in May after she was suspended from hosting her own show, Tomi, on TheBlaze in March when she expressed her belief that women should have legal access to abortion, a view rarely shared by her fellow conservatives.Watch a portion of Handler s interview with Lahren here:Featured image via Joshua Blanchard/Getty Images for Politicon)"," Tomi Lahren Blasts ObamaCare, Admits She’s Still On Parents’ Health Insurance [VIDEO]"
1,Fake,"July 30, 2017",News,"Donald Trump made became a household name in the 80s after pretending to write a book called  The Art of the Deal.  After that, his reputation was sealed as a great negotiator   or so his followers thought.That illusion was shattered on Friday, though, after the Senate failed to pass its latest attempt at repealing Obamacare. Despite Trump s last minute appeal to John McCain, McCain became one of three Republicans who are credited with killing the bill.It turns out that the real deal-maker in this scenario was our former Vice President. Joe Biden called his friend and former colleague before the vote. Former Senator Joe Lieberman did the same.While we don t know what Trump said to McCain that apparently had no effect, one of the reasons it fell on deaf ears is Trump s blatant insincerity. On the campaign trial, Trump disparaged McCain, saying he preferred people who weren t captured   referring to the fact that McCain was captured by North Vietnamese and held and tortured in a POW camp for 5 1/5 years.Before the vote, and after McCain had voted to let the vote go forward, Trump tweeted that McCain was a hero.Biden s call may or may not have been the deciding factor in McCain s vote, but you can be sure it was more meaningful than Trump s. Biden, unlike Trump, can be kind and diplomatic, even when there are political disagreements. Biden is capable of emotional appeals, simply because he experiences empathy, something Trump completely lacks. Biden also has first-hand experience with the kind of brain cancer for which McCain is currently undergoing treatment. He lost his son to it. You can be sure that Biden, in his heartfelt way, helped convince McCain that no one should be denied treatment for such a cruel disease.The Post reported that Biden had a more emotional discussion with McCain, reflecting on his son Beau Biden s death to the same brain cancer McCain was diagnosed with earlier this month. Biden s son died in 2015, two years after his initial diagnosis.Source: The HillWhatever or whoever convinced McCain to do the right thing, it s clear that Trump s deal-making abilities don t translate to D.C.

1,Fake,"July 30, 2017",News,"With a very dramatic flair, Senator John McCain joined his Republican colleagues, Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins, in torpedoing the GOP s Trumpcare bill. But just days earlier, everyone with any sense was absolutely furious with McCain for voting  yes  to advance Trumpcare to the Senate floor for a full vote.We all felt betrayed, particularly since that  yes  had come from a man recently diagnosed with a very aggressive type of cancer. He has to return to his home state of Arizona for treatments most people can t afford without insurance, that many can t afford even with insurance, and that could bankrupt entire families later on if things like lifetime caps on coverage are ever reinstated.But it s possible that McCain actually had a grander plan, and his  yes  vote, moving the bill out of committee, was carefully calculated. The Senate was trying to pass Trumpcare under a process known as reconciliation, which only requires a simple majority to pass, instead of the usual 60-vote threshold. Check this out:Amazing. Also clear now that McCain s yes on motion to proceed is what killed the bill. https://t.co/4CRz8VABeE pic.twitter.com/jzqVqmiZmJ  Steve Simitzis   (@s5) July 28, 2017Essentially, what McCain did was make it so they can t advance another Trumpcare bill to the floor and try to pass it as a reconciliation measure, at least, not without some massive changes to what they re trying to do. The Senate can actually try to pass up to three reconciliation measures each year, but only one each for spending, revenues, and debt limit. They can also put any two or all three into a single bill.While Republicans are still trying to scramble to put something together, they ll have a very difficult time getting another reconciliation bill to the floor.So McCain seems to have made a point of advancing the bill specifically so he, along with Murkowski, Collins, and the entire Democratic wing of the Senate, could effectively kill it for the rest of the fiscal year. And it was a giant f*ck you to McConnell as well, who was sure he had the votes to pass it since McCain had voted  yes  on the procedural motion.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", McCain F*cked Over Senate Republicans On Trumpcare In A Much Better Way Than We Already Knew
1,Fake,"July 30, 2017",News,"Donald Trump becomes more unhinged by the day. The week we just witnessed is his craziest yet. First, there was the hyper-partisan, free-wheeling speech he gave to a bunch of children at the Boy Scouts  Jamboree. The speech outraged so many people that the Boy Scouts of America had to apologize. Then, while speaking in front of police officers in Long Island, New York, Trump openly endorsed and encouraged police brutality in a racist speech sure to fire up his mouthbreathing base. And of course, there was the ouster of White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus via Twitter, who he humiliated as he was pushed out the door. To top it all off, he called for banning transgender soldiers from the military without even telling the Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff first. This major, sweeping policy change was also made via Twitter.Through all of this madness, there were, of course, Trump s repeated and sustained attacks on his own Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. Even though this should have Republicans reeling with outrage, and some Capitol Hill Republicans have fired warning shots at Trump about Sessions, there is one person who has been suspiciously silent throughout the chaos: Mike Pence, Trump s second-in-command.Well, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) thinks she knows the reason for that. Taking to Twitter on Saturday evening, Rep. Waters said what anyone watching is likely thinking: Pence is just riding out the Trump insanity until the Republicans on Capitol Hill finally decide they ve had enough, and they pull the trigger on Trump. This, of course, would make Pence President. Here is that tweet:Mike Pence is somewhere planning an inauguration. Priebus and Spicer will lead the transition.  Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) July 30, 2017Rep. Waters is likely right. There s no way establishment Republicans like Mike Pence actually like living with Donald Trump as president. He is, and always has been, nothing more than a vehicle to put them in power. And honestly, because of the chaos, Trump has exactly zero legislative achievements. Sure, Jeff Sessions is doing awful things from the DOJ, but those horrific policies can be promptly reversed once a new administration arrives. Trump is ignorant, incompetent, and crazy. Pence, however, is much more dangerous. I can t believe I m saying this, but I truly hope Rep. Waters  predictions never come to pass.

1,Fake,"July 29, 2017",News,"Donald Trump just beat Bill Clinton at something, and it s very embarrassing.The first six months of Trump s presidency has been a humiliating failure.The scandals, the investigations, the legislative stalls, the infighting, the firings, the whining, and the incompetence have all resulted in an approval rating that is the worst in American history.The ongoing and ever-growing Russia scandal has contributed most to Trump s woes as it has engulfed him and many members of his administration and family, including Jeff Sessions, Donald Trump Jr., and Jared Kushner.But when Newsweek took a look at how Trump s approval ratings compare to Bill Clinton s during his own scandals, the publication discovered that Trump s numbers are even more humiliating.In 1998, Republicans attempted to impeach President Clinton for having an affair with Monica Lewinsky and lying about it under oath. The scandal rocked Washington for months as conservatives salivated over the prospect of ousting Clinton and embarrassing Democrats. Needless to say, the story was national news for months.But Clinton s sex scandal was not nearly as scandalous as Trump s collusion with Russia during the 2016 Election is. That s because Trump s scandal violates our democratic process and is considered treason against the country.Never before had a foreign nation colluded with a candidate s campaign to help them win the presidency.But that s what happened as Trump Jr s own emails demonstrate. As Trump s Russia scandal deepens and the investigations get closer to the truth, Trump is panicking and is desperate to kill the investigation.The scandal has resulted in a record low approval rating of 37 percent, according to the latest Gallup poll.And that number is far lower than anything Clinton received at the height of his own scandal.Newsweek pointed out that Clinton s scandal hit national airwaves on January 21, 1998. Clinton s approval rating, however, climbed to 69 percent by the next month. And it would remain above 60 percent the rest of the year.Throughout the spring and summer months, the scandal dominated cable news and headlines but Clinton would not see his approval rating dip below 60 percent. And come August 1998, Gallup s three polls showed ratings of 64, 65 and 62 percent.Even after the impeachment trial, Clinton s approval rating never fell below 53 percent. Trump began his presidency with 45 percent, and it has only continued to dip.Clearly, Americans care more about the integrity of the democratic process than they do about an extramarital affair.This is not something that Trump is going to brag about. In all likelihood, Trump will seethe over this until he explodes in rage on Twitter, something else that has revolted Americans since he took office.But Trump only has himself to blame. His campaign colluded with the Russians and Trump has spent a lot of time lying about it and trying to obstruct the investigation.When and if Trump does get impeached, he won t have the support of the American people like Clinton did.

1,Fake,"July 29, 2017",News,"Once again, Donald Trump gets hilariously reminded of why people love President Obama.As we all know by now, Trump fired chief of staff Reince Priebus on Friday by leaving him all by himself on the tarmac after landing at Andrews Air Force Base. The firing comes only days after new communications director Anthony Scaramucci trashed him.Apparently, even Trump himself repeatedly demeaned Priebus, even going so far so as to call him  weak  and calling into the Oval Office to kill flies.Yeah, you heard that right.According to the Washington Post,For Trump, the imperative to remove Priebus heightened over the past 10 days or so, according to White House officials It reached a fever pitch of the president complaining about Reince to all of us,  said one senior White House official, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.  If we heard it once, we heard it 20 times in the last week   this erosion of confidence. The word was  weak     weak,   weak,   weak.   Can t get it done. Trump s demeaning of Priebus came through in other ways, too. At one point, during a meeting in the Oval Office, a fly began buzzing overhead, distracting the president. As the fly continued to circle, Trump summoned his chief of staff and tasked him with killing the insect, according to someone familiar with the incident.Indeed, being summoned to the Oval Office just to kill a fly is incredibly demeaning and shows exactly the kind of terrible boss Trump is.After all, President Obama never summoned any of his top staff members into the Oval Office to kill flies. In fact, Obama had the skills to kill his own flies, as he did during an interview early on in his presidency.Here s the video via YouTube.So while Donald Trump is apparently too lazy or too scared to kill flies on his own, President Obama took matters into his own hands and got the job done.Of course, the Internet had fun mocking Trump and Priebus for the incident.(Unconfirmed):Priebus was ordered to swallow the fly,  then a spider, then a bird, then a cat, etc  ?

Which is weird, because a dude named Jason Brown murdered a police officer in Indianapolis on Thursday.I can t help but think if his skin matched his name, you d already know who I was talking about.

1,Fake,"July 28, 2017",News,"One of the things that has plagued America   besides Donald Trump himself   is the POTUS  Twitter usage. Every day, Trump s Twitter account serves as an endless amount of humiliation and chaos for a country that was once well-respected around the world. While Trump has proven to his staff (and the country) that he cannot be controlled on social media, a federal court may have just ruled that there are some things he just CANNOT do on Twitter.One of Trump s most disturbing behaviors lies in his tendency to block people on Twitter just because they disagree with him. Currently, Trump is being sued by the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University for blocking people just because they expressed criticism. Thanks to a federal court ruling that happened this week, Trump may not be able to do that anymore.This week, a federal court ruled on a case very similar to Trump s, in which the chair of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Phyllis J. Randall, had been blocking constituents on her public Facebook page. In the case Davison v. Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, Randall wrote on her county Facebook page, I really want to hear from ANY Loudoun citizen on ANY issues, request, criticism, compliment, or just your thoughts.  When Brian C. Davidson took her up on her offer, bringing up the alleged corruption in the county s school board, Randall responded by deleting his comment and blocking him. The following morning, Randall unblocked Davidson but he was not able to comment on her page or send her messages. Davidson argued that this was a violation of his freedom of speech, and a federal court ruled in his favor.U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris ruled that this was a violation of the First Amendment s Free Speech Clause because Randall was  offended by his criticism of her colleagues in the County government , which he regarded as unconstitutional  viewpoint discrimination    pretty much what Trump does on Twitter. Cacheris explained:Defendant s offense at Plaintiff s views was therefore an illegitimate basis for her actions particularly given that Plaintiff earned Defendant s ire by criticizing the County government. Indeed, the suppression of critical commentary regarding elected officials is the quintessential form of viewpoint discrimination against which the First Amendment guards. By prohibiting Plaintiff from participating in her online forum because she took offense at his claim that her colleagues in the County government had acted unethically, Defendant committed a cardinal sin under the First Amendment.This certainly has implications to what might happen with Trump s own Twitter account. While Trump might try to argue that his personal Twitter page   separate from the @POTUS presidential account   is not intended to function as a public forum, it s obvious that Trump uses it to make presidential announcements. Members of his own team, such as former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, have even stated that Trump s tweets are  official statements    which means this account should be subjected to the same rules as Randall s public Facebook page was.Featured image via Steve Pope / Getty Images", Federal Court Rules Against Trump’s Unpresidential Twitter Behavior (DETAILS)

According to Page Six, Ball is filing for divorce because of Scaramucci s ambition and his desire to get close to Trump, who she can t stand. They have been married for three years and have two children together.One source told Page Six,  Deidre has left him and has filed for divorce.

This was his second marriage and Ball was noticeably not present at his recent SALT conference in mid-May.The New York Post is traditionally one of the few media outlets that refuses to report on everything negative about the Trump administration and ,maybe the reason this story made the papers is that it s all about Scaramucci s swooning love affair with Trump.

In essence, he threatened to withhold all kinds of funding from her state as punishment for her vote. According to the Alaska Post-Dispatch:Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan (who voted  yes  on the motion) said the call from Zinke heralded a  troubling message. I m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,  Sullivan said.Efforts and issues on the line include nominations of Alaskans to Interior posts, an effort to build a road out of King Cove through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and future opportunities to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expand drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, among other regulatory issues that are a priority for Murkowski and Sullivan.This is Trump trying to force members of Congress to bend to his will. It s a strong arm tactic that s beneath the Office of the President and patently disgusting to boot. It s reminiscent of a scene in Full Metal Jacket where Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann begins punishing his entire platoon for one private s ongoing problems during basic training.Raul Grijalva, a representative from Arizona, has called for an investigation into Zinke s threats against Alaska. He s the top Democrat on the House Committee on Natural Resources and plans to ask both the Government Accountability Office and the Department of the Interior s Inspector General s office to investigate.Good.Murkowski, for her part, isn t cowed. She says she promised to work with the new administration on things that matter to Alaskans, and she intends to continue on that path. She doesn t believe the administration will actually cut off Alaska, but the fact that anyone in the administration threatened her state over her vote remains.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Trump Admin Deals STUNNING Threat To Alaska Over Their Senator’s ‘No’ Vote On ACA Repeal
1,Fake,"July 27, 2017",News,"You thought the people passing through Fargo, North Dakota were crazy. Now we have to worry about wood chippers in the Wal-Mart parking lot.On Tuesday, genuinely terrifying racist Amber E. Hensley confronted some Muslim women who she felt had  parked too close  for her to get in her car, although vehicle proximity may not have been the only factor, it appears. In mere moments, the disagreement turned into death threats against sisters Sarah and Laleyla Hassan and another passenger in their car, Rowda Soyan. All are Somali-American Muslims.The trio was on their way to see a movie, Raw Story reports, when they were approached by Hensley, who shouted at them through the window of their car. After exchanging taunts about who was or was not an American, the sister with the camera, Sarah, asked the woman  what are you gonna do?  Hensley leaned in and told the young women just what her intentions were: We re gonna kill all of ya. We re gonna kill every one of you fuckin  Muslims.Later, she asked the would-be moviegoers  why are you in our country, anyway? Hensley was fired nearly as soon as the video went public. From a statement issued by Horab & Wentz, the accounting firm where she previously worked:The women, of course, disagreed about what happened when the camera wasn t rolling. After her firing, Amber Hensley posted an  apology  on her now-deleted Facebook page:In an interview with the Twin Cities Pioneer Press, Sarah Hassan denied ever having insulted Jesus.We Muslims, we believe in Jesus, too. If I abuse Jesus it s like I m abusing my own god and I not going to be considered a Muslim.This is a common mistake among Christians who don t know anything about Islam. There are a great many parallels between the two Abrahamic religions, although names differ between them. In addition to lying about what Sarah said, Sarah claims that Hensley also mocked her sister Lalelya s crossed eyes and said it was the reason the women were parked so poorly.Amber Hensley was, of course, a big fan of Donald Trump:Trump may have said some things years ago  But Hilary has BLOOD on her hands!

1,Fake,"July 27, 2017",News,"While the GOP Congress has mostly fallen right in line behind their Dear Orange Leader, there are some signs that the veneer of support is beginning to crack. On Thursday, Congress sent Donald Trump a near unanimous bill that will test Trump s patriotism and his allegiance to Russia.The bill would increase sanctions against Iran, North Korea and Russia. It would also prevent Trump from easing current sanctions against Russia. In the Senate, only Bernie Sanders and Rand Paul voted against the bill (Sanders said it could interfere with the Iran nuclear agreement). The House s bill passed by a vote of 419 to 3. In other words, even if Trump vetoes the bill, Congress will easily override it.Under the bill, the president is required to notify Congress before making any alterations to Russia sanctions policy, and lawmakers then have 30 days in which they can block the president from implementing those changes. The procedure, known as  congressional review,  is the most sweeping authority Congress has given itself to check the president on sanctions policy in decades.Such matters have traditionally been left to the executive branch once Congress authorizes the sanctions at the administration s disposal. Even in the case of mandatory sanctions, Congress usually steers clear of the president on matters of national security.If Trump does veto the bill, that s a tacit admission that yes, he is a Putin puppet. If he doesn t, it s a signal to Russia that Trump is no longer living up to the bargain. There is no winning on this one.While White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she doesn t know whether Trump will sign the bill, Trump s new Communications Director, Anthony Scaramucci, hinted that Trump might veto the bill, but only to  negotiate an even tougher deal against the Russians.  If you believe that, I have some Trump University diplomas for sale.This is an interesting trap. It shows that Congress (at least most of them) doesn t trust Trump with national security. If that s not an admission of guilt on the part of the Republican Party, I don t know what is.

1,Fake,"July 27, 2017",News,"Thursday afternoon, the US Senate passed new sanctions against Russia with a vote of 97-2. Just two Republicans   Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah   voted against the bill, which passed the House on Tuesday with a similar percentage of Yea votes. Both chambers served up a veto-proof majority in a show of bipartisan action rarely seen outside honorary legislation.The bill provides new sanctions for Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and includes a stunning rebuke to the president, whose power is stymied by the language of the legislation. Congressional approval would be required for the president to subsequently lift or even ease any sanctions. The measure came in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, solidifying the consensus among literally everyone except Donald Trump, who still occasionally denies interference altogether, when he s not blaming Barack Obama for not doing anything about it.Democratic Representative Ted Lieu, who has been a frequent foil for Trump on his favorite social media platform, was on Twitter in a heartbeat after passage of the bill:As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Cmte, I know this sanctions bill is a great deal for America.

He started talking about Steve Bannon s penis:Scaramucci was particularly incensed by a Politico report about his financial-disclosure form, which he viewed as an illegal act of retaliation by Priebus.

His great company has seen our you know, you see exactly what I m saying our administration s work to remove job-killing regulations he s been watching to institute Buy American and Hire American, and all of those policies, and to pursue the steps necessary to revitalize American industry, including repealing and replacing Obamacare we better get that done, fellas, please. It should be pointed out that Foxconn was already planning to build a factory in the United States long before Trump ever considered running for president.But if Trump really wants to take credit, that means he is also taking credit for Republicans screwing over the people of Wisconsin to get the factory to come to their state.You see, in exchange for Foxconn choosing Wisconsin, Republican lawmakers and Governor Scott Walker approved a $3 billion subsidy for the company. According to Bloomberg, that amounts to taking $519 from every man, woman, and child in Wisconsin to fund what the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel points out  would total more than the combined yearly state funding used to operate the University of Wisconsin System and the state s prison system. And let s remember that we are talking about a private company that is already worth billions. Foxconn does not need billions of dollars of government subsidies to expand. They have the money to do it themselves. This amounts to nothing more than Foxconn holding the people of Wisconsin hostage and Republicans letting them and complying with their demands.And that is especially disastrous for Wisconsin since Foxconn is known for promising investments and not delivering.As Bloomberg reported,Three years ago, Gou signed a deal with the government of Jakarta, Indonesia s capital and its biggest city, to invest $1 billion and employ local workers to make electronics. That never happened. Neither did a $30 million high-tech factory in Pennyslvania that was announced a year earlier. Just this past year, Foxconn is reported to have pledged investments of $5 billion in India; $3.65 billion in Kunshan, China; and $8.8 billion in Guangzhou. It s too early to know if those sums will ever be spent, but including Wisconsin, the tally now stands at $27.5 billion of commitments. That s more than Hon Hai [Foxconn s flagship company] has spent in the last 23 years.So while Trump is busy touting the deal to make himself look good, he is doing so at the expense of Wisconsin taxpayers, many of whom now have to worry about how they will get by after paying Foxconn s ransom.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images", Trump-Touted Wisconsin Deal Forces Taxpayers To Shell Out $3 Billion
1,Fake,"July 27, 2017",News,"Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) has never been a fan of Donald Trump. He regularly criticized Trump throughout his disastrous campaign and very publicly refused to support him or vote for him. Now that we are six months into this American nightmare of a  presidency,  it seems that Senator Graham is more than done with Trump. When asked about Trump s repeated attacks on Attorney General Jeff Sessions, as well as his flagrant attempts to impede and obstruct Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia investigation, Graham did not mince words. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Graham said: If Jeff Sessions is fired, there will be holy hell to pay. He went on to say that Trump is clearly trying to  humiliate  and  marginalize  his own Attorney General. After that, he said that any attempts to fire Mueller could be the beginning of the end of the Trump presidency. That s about as blatant a threat of impeachment as any GOP lawmaker has lobbed at Trump. It seems that Graham is finally standing up and actually telling his GOP colleagues that protecting our democracy is much more important than protecting Trump. Throughout the campaign and now as he occupies the Oval Office, Trump has proven himself to be unfit. He has careened from outrage to outrage, and increasingly lessened America s standing on the world stage.Now, it seems even his own party is sick of him. Just Wednesday night, Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley warned Trump that he would not confirm an Attorney General this year if Trump fires Sessions. Now, we have Lindsey Graham insisting that Trump must stop trying to turn America into a banana republic.Trump would do well to listen to these men.

Brat represents Virginia s 7th District, which may explain his love of both Sessions and Trump, and his desire to blame someone else for their falling out. The 7th District was created in 1993 by decree of the Department of Justice, who forced the state to create at least one  majority minority  district in order to comply with Section 5 of the Civil Rights Act. Much of the urban areas of Richmond were carved out into a new 3rd District, and what was left   the mainly white voters   were left in the 7th.Being as Trump and Sessions are now the two most powerful racists in America, it stands to reason that a guy representing an area that hasn t voted for a single Democrat in more than 45 years   and never elected a person of color  would want them to get along.In a statement released by Brat s office on Wednesday, he decried the  full-throated obsession over Russia  by the media, which he said could not have been foreseen at the time of Sessions  recusal from the investigation. That recusal has been the source of the recent enmity between the AG and the president. From the statement:The media s attacks have only escalated since Trump s inauguration. Fake news dominates. Anchors now make the news by opinion, instead of reporting objective reality.

Most of the time, the arbitrators rule in favor of the institution.In a sample of 19,300 cases, arbitrators ruled in favor of consumers 5 percent of the time. Meanwhile, arbitration firms used by companies such as MasterCard, Visa, Discover Financial Services and American Express Co. won 95 percent of the disputes, the study showed.Source: Seattle PIFrivolous, like when Donald Trump sued a man for daring to be born with the name Donald Trump, or when he sued a Miss USA contestant, or when he sued the Chicago Tribune for doubting Trump s Chicago building would eclipse the then Sears (and now Willis) Tower.Altogether, Trump has been involved in more than 3,500 lawsuits, but despite the fact that our taxpayers pay for courts, he wants to take the option to use them away from us, unless we can afford pricey attorneys.Class action lawsuits are democratic; they give the people a voice. In Trump s and in Republicans  world, though, consumer rights are inconvenient for profits. We should just shut up and when a bank-salaried arbitrator tells us we need to take it up the you-know-what, we d better take it up the you-know-what.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", Trump Is Trying To Make It Illegal For Groups Of People He’s Screwed To Sue Him
1,Fake,"July 26, 2017",News,"Amateur president Donald Trump is donating his second-quarter salary to the Department of Education, the White House announced Wednesday. During her daily press briefing, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who was besieged with questions about Trump s Twitter announcement saying that he s banning transgender Americans from serving in the military, told everyone about the $100,000 donation. Huckabee Sanders then handed the check signed by the former reality show star to Education Secretary Betsy Devos, a billionaire.Now, while they may seem generous on the surface, Trump has proposed slashing the Education Department by $9.2 billion. That s a 14 percent reduction so $100,000 is a mere drop in the bucket.And while he s profiting from his businesses, typically every weekend when the 71-year-old needs a break, he threw his relatively meager salary at the very department he s stripping funding from.DeVos announced that the money would go toward hosting a science, technology, engineering, and mathematics camp for children at the department. We want to encourage as many students as possible to pursue STEM fields,  DeVos said.Trump's donation to Dept of Education: $100,000.Spending cut to education in Trump's proposed 2018 budget: $9,200,000,000.

1,Fake,"July 26, 2017",News,"Trump apparently will continue the feud he started with Jeff Sessions when he said he thought Sessions had been very unfair in recusing himself from the Russia investigation. He wants someone who is going to be 100 percent blindly loyal (meaning someone who will stop any and all investigations into him and his family and open investigations into Hillary and the Democrats), and clearly, Sessions isn t it. So, according to one of Trump s close advisers, he will torture Sessions until he resigns:He wants to fire him but he doesn t want the confrontation. He doesn t mind the long negative storyline. He will torture him every single day. When Trump gets all butthurt like this, he focuses his ire on the perceived guilty party and doesn t let it go until they either cave or someone manages to convince him to let it go. Sessions, thus far, has maintained that he will not resign, and, well, Trump just can t have that.According to Politico, Trump has been whining up one side and down the other about Sessions  decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation to anyone who will listen. Not only did Trump say that was unfair to him, but he also said that, if he d known Sessions was going to take the job and then recuse himself, he would never have  given  him the job in the first place. To Trump, recusal in this situation is a grave abdication of responsibility and a betrayal of trust when the person doing so is supposed to be on Trump s side (if they re an opponent, of course, they must recuse over the slightest possible conflict).Sessions, for his part, doesn t seem to know what the problem is. One person close to him said that they ve spoken to people in the West Wing and nobody understands why Trump is doing this. But Trump, never one to let go of a grudge until his enemy is completely vanquished (and sometimes, not even then), reportedly wants to see how Sessions will respond to things like mockery and humiliation.If Sessions does resign, Trump will eventually turn his ire on someone else. He wants sycophants, not people who will do their jobs.Featured image via Michael Reynolds and Mark Wilson/Getty Images", Trump Will ‘Torture’ Sessions Every Day Until He Resigns: Report
1,Fake,"July 26, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s approval rating continues to plummet in its downward spiral, and it seems to be getting lower by the week. The latest bad news for the man baby in the White House will be that more Americans disapprove of Trump s job performance than approve in 31 states across the country. Here s the real kicker   this includes 11 states that he d actually won in November!It turns out, not even Trump s most supportive audiences are willing to stand by him after watching him try to burn our country to the ground on a weekly basis. The states that have changed their minds about Trump include Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Michigan and Florida, Ohio, Iowa, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona   and two states that shocked everyone   Indiana and Texas.You can check out how the states are rating Trump below:Trump has been setting records left and right during his presidency   and almost 100% of it is negative. Over the last three months, Gallup noted that the disgraceful POTUS  approval rating (39 percent) has set records lows for a president in his second quarter.When many of those states might have supported Trump last year, it seems they re running in the opposite direction now. In Texas and Indiana, there is now a major difference between the states  approval of Trump in November, and how the American people feel about him now. For example, in Indiana (where Vice President Mike Pence hails from), Trump had won that state by 19 points in November. Less than a year later, he is now one point underwater. In Texas, Trump had won by nine points last year. Now, he s nine points under in that state.This is not looking good for Trump at all, as he is consistently failing in each of these once pro-Trump states:What this tells us is that even Trump s supporters are getting tired of his bullsh*t and are regretful that they didn t put their vote behind a real presidential candidate. Any Republican who wanted to give Trump the benefit of the doubt is certainly having second thoughts now.To a normal leader, this would be devastating. Any respectable president would be panicking and consumed with how they are going to turn this around. But not Trump!

1,Fake,"July 26, 2017",News,"Because today ends in a Y, Donald Trump took to his twitter account to bash a group of people; this time it was transgender Americans. In a series of early morning tweets on Wednesday, Trump announced that he plans to reinstate a ban on transgender individuals serving  in any capacity  in the U.S. armed forces, thus overturning the Obama-era rule. Trump s decision is in stark contrast to his vow during his campaign last year in which he said he would be a better friend to the LGBTQ community than Hillary Clinton.  I will tell you who the better friend is and some day I believe that will be proven out big league,  Trump said at the time.According to the RAND Corporation, in 2016 there were between 1,320 and 6,630 transgender people serving in the military.On Wednesday, a retired Navy SEAL team 6 hero who is transgendered, called out Trump over his decision to ban trans people from serving in the U.S. military, telling him to tell her to her face that she is not worthy of serving.Kristin Beck, a 20-year-veteran of the Navy SEALS, was interviewed by Business Insider about Trump s ban and she had a few choice words for the amateur president. Let s meet face to face and you tell me I m not worthy,  Kristin Beck said, referring to President Bone Spurs.  Transgender doesn t matter. Do your service. Being transgender doesn t affect anyone else,  Beck continued.  We are liberty s light. If you can t defend that for everyone that s an American citizen, that s not right. Beck was deployed 13 times over two decades and served in Bosnia, Iraq, and Afghanistan, according to Business Insider. She received the Bronze Star award for valor and the Purple Heart for wounds suffered in combat so she served our country well. I was defending individual liberty,  she said.  I defended for Republicans. I defended for Democrats. I defended for everyone. We re picturing Trump being fired upon as a soldier comes up to rescue him.  Are you transgendered, because if you are, you are not supposed to be here.  No one would be surprised if Trump started unleashing mean-girl tweets about the retired Navy SEAL.

Donald J.

Spicer announced his intention to resign last week and will formally step down from the role in August, so now it s Scaramucci s duty to try and justify whatever move President Trump makes next and he is more than aware that it will most likely be the firing of Sessions.In fact, Scaramucci has already come straight out and said that Trump  probably  wants Sessions gone. The comment came during an interview with conservative MSNBC host Hugh Hewitt, who made the statement  it s clear the President wants him gone,  in reference to Sessions. I have an enormous amount of respect for the Attorney General,  was Scaramucci s reply.  But I do know the President pretty well. And if there s this level of tension in the relationship that s public, you re probably right. But I don t want to speak for the President on that because he s a Cabinet official. And I sort of think that has to be between the President of the United States and a Cabinet official. But Scaramucci didn t stop there. Far from it. Rather, he continued by going into detail of how a person like Barack Obama s Attorney General, Eric Holder, would be the perfect fit for Trump in order to build a great Cabinet relationship. You and I might be at odds with Eric Holder politically,  Scaramucci told Hewitt.  But one of the things I would give him a lot of credit for is that he was a pretty good hockey goalie for the president. He was also willing to help the president inside the bounds of the law. I m not saying these guys did anything illegal. But when you think about the relationship John Kennedy had with his brother as Attorney General, or you think about the relationship the president had with Eric Holder   President Obama  [Trump and Sessions] probably don t have that sort of relationship. And I think the president, when he thinks about the architecture of his Cabinet, I think he needs that sort of a relationship there. So Barack Obama might be the only person Trump dislikes almost as much as Hillary Clinton, but the President really needs someone like Obama s Attorney General right now in order to build some solidarity according to the White House Communications Director.

1,Fake,"July 26, 2017",News,"When Donald Trump addressed the Boy Scouts  National Jamboree Monday night, nobody could possibly have expected the cluster bomb of impropriety he detonated in the middle of a crowd of kids. From regaling the youngsters with tales of  interesting  yacht outings and real estate moguls, to leading them in a chorus of boos at the expense of Barack Obama, Trump essentially used a gathering that usually represents the best of America as a campaign rally with a captive audience.That s just how former CIA Director John McLaughlin saw it, as well:Trump's Boy Scout speech had the feel of a third world authoritarian's youth rally.  john mclaughlin (@jmclaughlinSAIS) July 25, 2017In an interview with Business Insider, McLaughlin said the speech  gave [him] the creeps.

1,Fake,"July 26, 2017",News,"According to lawyers for Donald Trump, it was completely fine for the now President to have encouraged supporters to use  reasonable force  to remove disruptive protestors from his campaign rallies last year, as he was just exercising his right to freedom of speech by doing so.The claim came during an emergency motion asking the US appeals court to throw out a lawsuit filed by three people who believe they were manhandled at a Trump rally that took place during March last year in Louisville, KY. Fortunately for the two women and one man, U.S. District Judge David Hale refused to dismiss the case, stating that the plaintiffs  lawsuit  described a chaotic and violent scene in which a crowd of people turned on three individuals,  with the plaintiffs being punched, kicked and verbally abused. According to Trumps lawyers, one of the plaintiffs, an African American woman, had held up a  sign depicting Trump s face on the body of pig, Trump kept saying,  Get them out, get them out,  and people in the crowd began pushing and shoving the protesters,  said Alvin Bamberger, one of the audience members at the rally who was cited in the lawsuit and the one whom the plaintiffs described as the  most aggressive.  The President s lawyers felt the need to add that, in Trump s defence, he did say at the time,  Don t hurt  em. If I say,  Go get  em,  I get in trouble with the press, the most dishonest human beings in the world. The plaintiffs are attempting to sue Trump and his campaign, but the real question here is whether Trump should be deemed responsible for having incited, or at the very least, provoked the violence in the first place. The three people beaten and abused at the Louisville rally do, hence the reason why they re seeking damages from the President for what they believe was a reckless incitement of violence.President Trump s lawyers claim in their latest motion that protesters who  initially purchased tickets and entered the rally in a peaceful manner  can also be forcibly removed if they become disruptive. It also makes no difference whether the crowd reacted with unlawful violence beyond what Mr. Trump advocated, because the hostile reaction of the crowd does not not transform protected speech into incitement,  the lawyers added in their statement.Judge Hale believes the plaintiffs  complaint is more than enough to proceed toward a trial, writing in his March 31 order It is plausible that Trump s directive to  get  em out of here  advocated the use of force. [It] is stated in the imperative; it was an order, an instruction, a command. Trump s lawyers, however, believe that, not only is that a reasonable order for Trump to give, it is also his right. Without this court s intervention, this litigation will inflict irreparable harm on the Trump defendants by subjecting them to punitive litigation as the price of exercising their core First Amendment rights,  Washington attorney Michael Carvin said wrote. Mr. Trump had a First Amendment right to call for the removal of disruptive protesters from his campaign rally, and it is a bedrock principle of law that the right to exclude another   includes the right to use reasonable force. Furthermore, Trump s lawyers filed a  writ of mandamus  with the U.S. 6th Circuit Court this week, asking the appeals court to remove the case from Hale. Their argument was that Trump cannot be held liable for  negligently inspiring third parties to engage in violence.

1,Fake,"July 25, 2017",News,"Mental health professionals will now be allowed to openly diagnose Donald Trump.For the first time since 1973, a rule that prevents mental health professionals from publicly giving their expert opinion on the mental health of a public figure will no longer be enforced by the American Psychoanalytical Association.The rule was put in place after Barry Goldwater sued Fact Magazine for publishing a poll in which a majority of psychiatrists declared him mentally unfit to be president. Goldwater would go on to lose the presidential election of 1964.But ever since Trump declared his candidacy and began saying and doing insane things in public, many psychiatrists have openly defied the rule in order to inform Americans on his mental state.Fox News pundit Charles Krauthammer, who is also a board-certified psychiatrist, wrote a brutal diagnose of Trump s mental health last August. Trump s hypersensitivity and unedited, untempered Pavlovian responses are, shall we say, unusual in both ferocity and predictability. This is beyond narcissism. I used to think Trump was an 11-year-old, an undeveloped schoolyard bully. I was off by about 10 years. His needs are more primitive, an infantile hunger for approval and praise, a craving that can never be satisfied. He lives in a cocoon of solipsism where the world outside himself has value   indeed exists   only insofar as it sustains and inflates him. In addition, Dr. Drew Pinsky also expressed concerns about Trump s mental health. The question, though, is, are some of the reckless qualities that everyone is getting so disturbed about on the campaign going to be translated into office should he get elected? That s a pretty hard thing to predict. I don t know if this is just somebody playing politics, or is this somebody who really can t contain their impulses? When I hear people that are impulsive with their speech, I worry about hypomania and bipolar types of conditions. At the time, psychiatrists were warned to avoid diagnosing Trump without personally examining him first. But that has all changed.Six months into Trump s presidency, the American Psychoanalytical Association has given permission to their 3,500 members to do just that.And you can bet Trump s head is going to explode.Former APA president Dr. Prudence Gourguechon explained the decision to STAT News. We don t want to prohibit our members from using their knowledge responsibly since Trump s behavior is so different from anything we ve seen before,  Dr. Gouguechon said.Indeed, Americans need this knowledge now more than ever before as Trump continues to lash out at anyone who criticizes him and is even starting to throw members of his own administration under the bus. His emotions and behavior are so unpredictable that it is understandable that people would worry, especially considering that Trump has access to nuclear weapons.It s time for Americans and Congress to demand Trump undergo a mental health exam by a board-certified psychiatrist. Furthermore, it s time to invoke the 25th Amendment and declare Trump unfit to serve. This insanity has gone on long enough. America cannot continue to be led by an unstable narcissist. It s time to make America sane again.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images", American Psychoanalytic Association Gives Members Permission To Diagnose Trump’s Mental Health

Talking about, the FBI director gets fired, now trying to push the attorney general out  And there was discussion last week about pushing out or firing Mueller. I mean, you can t fire the FBI. The investigations are going to continue. I just don t   I don t understand why all this interference. It s not helpful, and it s very distracting.

1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"On Monday night, Donald Trump traveled to West Virginia to give a speech to a bunch of Boy Scouts   you know, children. In that speech, instead of inspiring them and being a role model, Trump chose to swear, re-litigate his Electoral College victory, talk about cocktail parties, and rant about political issues. Of course, this is a stunningly inappropriate speech for any adult to give to little kids, much less for someone in Trump s position to do it.There have been many responses to this insanity, but perhaps the best one came from Pete Souza, the enthusiastic photographer in the Obama White House. Souza s Instagram account has become a goldmine of images trolling Trump s most outrageous moments, and this one was no different. Souza posted the following photo during Trump s speech of President Obama greeting a young Boy Scout in the Oval Office:.@PeteSouza on Instagram responds to Trump's Boy Scouts speech pic.twitter.com/GtzQgsrSV4  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) July 25, 2017Of course, it also bears pointing out that President Obama was in the Indonesian equivalent of the Boy Scouts, while obviously Trump was never any kind of scout. Plus, when it comes to character, Obama exudes what the Scouts strive to be, while Trump is everything they don t want anyone to be.The striking part of all of this, though, is to show just how low we have gone as a country to have this orange fascist and his goons running it. Trump is racist, misogynistic, xenophobic, vindictive, a bully, and a con man. On the other side of that, President Obama was easily one of the most extraordinary human beings to ever hold that office. He is, as a person, the very definition of class and dignity.Oh, America, what have we done? How did we elect a man who is the best role model we could ask for when it comes to having behavior in the Oval Office we want future generations to emulate, to having a fraudulent vulgarian in there who exhibits behavior even toddlers know better to engage in?We can only speculate, but thank goodness for Pete Souza s Instagram account to help us remember what it was like to have a real president.Featured image via Official White House Photo by Pete Souza", Obama Photographer BRILLIANTLY Trolls Trump’s Wildly Inappropriate Speech To The Boy Scouts (IMAGE)
1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"Donald Trump is very busy right now trying to get rid of his Attorney General, one Jeff Sessions. This is pretty extraordinary, since Sessions endorsed Trump while the rest of the elected Republican establishment was still treating Trump s candidacy with a mix of comedy and horror. Now, however, times have changed. Trump wants Sessions gone, due his firm (and possibly true) belief that Sessions  decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation led to the appointment of Special Counsel Robert Mueller.As Mueller digs further into Trump World   including into Trump s finances, which Trump himself has said is some kind of red line   Trump is looking for a way to rid himself of the threat of what Mueller might find. With Sessions recused, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is the one who would have the authority to fire Robert Mueller. Rosenstein has gone on the record under oath as saying that he will do no such thing without just cause. The solution to all of this for Trump? Get rid of Sessions and Rosenstein, and appoint an Attorney General who will be a staunch and unwavering Trump loyalist.It has been speculated that Trump is considering that former New York Mayor and fervent Trump supporter Rudy Giuliani might be just the man to do this. However, there is just one problem with that: Giuliani likely wouldn t pass the Senate confirmation process in this climate. In order to appear non-partisan, even Senate Republicans would insist on a nominee who is not an obvious Trump stalwart. Plus, Rudy Giuliani already admitted on the air that he literally tried to help Trump find a way to ban Muslims from the nation without doing so explicitly so as to pass Constitutional muster. Then there was the time during the campaign when Giuliani seemed to know what would be in a batch of hacked anti-Hillary Clinton emails that were leaked shortly after his statements. So, yeah, big confirmation problems there.So, what s Trump to do? Well, that s easy. Go around the Senate completely and install any Attorney General he wants, by appointing someone during the recess that the Senate always takes in late summer. Problem solved. According to the Washington Post, Team Trump is considering doing just that, when it comes to weighing options to get a pro-Trump Attorney General. From WaPo:Another scenario is that Trump could make a recess appointment, said University of Texas School of Law professor Steve Vladeck. Under that plan, Trump could choose an attorney general during the August recess who would serve until the end of the next Senate session, which could be early January. That person would have the same authority as someone who is confirmed by the Senate, Vladeck said.Now obviously such a move would be nothing short of the height of corruption, and politically explosive for Congressional Republicans, especially if they don t warn him against doing this. We all know that Trump and the people in the White House don t care how something like that looks. They want Robert Mueller and his Russia investigation gone at all costs, and if it means looking guilty as hell to do it, so be it. Anyone who has paid attention knows that Rudy Giuliani would have absolutely no issue following a Trump order to fire Robert Mueller. He d relish the task, in fact, because that would put him in the highest regard in Trump World   perhaps permanently.Republicans, if this shit goes down like this, it s on your heads. It would literally spin us into a full-fledged Constitutional crisis. If Trump moves to fire Mueller, you need to impeach him.

1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"By now, we all know that upon having emergency surgery to remove a blood clot from above his left eye last week, it was discovered that Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer. Of course, Senator McCain is a giant in the Senate and around the world who wields massive amounts of influence   and for very good reason. Few in Washington right now have served more valiantly than he has. This is true regardless of whether one agrees with the man s politics. Therefore, he deserves our well wishes, and he and his family should be left in peace to deal with his illness in peace and privacy. This is not true, though, when it comes to the vultures in the Senate GOP Conference.Instead of leaving Senator McCain and his family alone, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, with such a slim majority in the Senate, has decided to drag the ailing Arizona Senator back to Washington just days after his devastating diagnosis and surgery. McConnell needs John McCain s vote on his disastrous healthcare legislation. Without McCain, McConnell could only lose one vote before the whole thing goes down in flames again for the umpteenth time, dealing yet another blow to the Republican Party and to the Trump Administration.Of course, since John McCain is such a fighter and a great American public servant, he has released a cordial statement saying that he will be looking forward to returning to work, even though it is obvious that the Senate is the last place he should be at such a critical time for his health. McCain s office released the following statement regarding the matter after getting medical clearance to go help McConnell out: Senator McCain looks forward to returning to the United States Senate tomorrow to continue working on important legislation, including health care reform, the National Defense Authorization Act, and new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea. The Senator himself tweeted:Look forward to returning to Senate tomorrow to continue work on health care reform, defense bill & #RussiaSanctions https://t.co/VQBtovnwF1  John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) July 25, 2017Of course, this is being spun as John McCain s own choice, made without pressure by those in the ranks of elected Republicans. However, considering the fact that there is enormous pressure for them to pass something   anything   on healthcare after campaigning for seven years to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, it s hard to believe that all the media attention to McCain s precious vote and the political risk of failure to McConnell didn t play a role here. Further, you can bet your bottom dollar McConnell himself probably told McCain to get his ass back to Washington come hell or high water in time for this vote.This is a new low, even for that vulturous turtle Mitch McConnell. He needs to leave John McCain and his family be. It also says a hell of a lot about the level of desperation he and his GOP Senate colleagues are feeling that they would pull a stunt like this in order to take healthcare from millions while giving massive tax cuts to the wealthiest Americans.John McCain is a better human than I, because if it were me, I d have told Mitch McConnell to go f*ck himself, and announced my retirement all in the same breath.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", BREAKING: Desperate GOP Senators Drag John McCain Back To Washington For Trumpcare Vote

It has only been a few days since former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer resigned from his role after a disagreement with Trump. Now, Trump might lose his Secretary of State, Rex Tillerson.According to two sources close to Tillerson, the Secretary of State is getting fed up with Trump and his incompetent administration. So much so, that he might actually leave Trump before the disgraceful POTUS can complete his first year in the White House.CNN reported that these sources said there soon could be a  Rexit  thanks to Trump s unprofessional comments about Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Last week, Trump had said he regretted hiring Sessions because the Attorney General recused himself from overseeing the Russia investigation. Then on Monday, Trump attacked Sessions AGAIN on Twitter, stating that he was beleaguered  and asked why Sessions wasn t investigating Hillary Clinton.It seems as though Tillerson has had enough of Trump s vile behavior   and that s not all. This is on top of the fact that Tillerson was just exposed for violating U.S. sanctions against Russia when he was the CEO of Exxon Mobil. The Secretary of State may have had all the drama he can handle and is ready to step out and abandon Trump during his time of need.Tillerson has had issues with Trump and his administration long before these details came to light, though. Over the last few months, Tillerson has butted heads with Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, and there were even reports that Trump might get rid of Tillerson because of it. And last month, Tillerson apparently had a meltdown during a meeting in White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus s office.Like many others, Tillerson is finally realizing that a position in Trump s failing administration isn t what he thought it would be. People are leaving Trump left and right, and the lonely POTUS only has himself to blame for it.

It didn t take long for someone to ridicule Trump for not abiding by his own rules. Democratic National Committee spokesperson Daniel Wessel called Trump out: Trump is putting his own interests and profits ahead of those of American businesses and workers.

As it turns out, not so much. The Government Accountability Office, which oversees other government agencies to check for fraud and abuse, decided to see just how careful the DoD was when it came to handing out spare military gear to law enforcement agencies. The result of their sting operation was shocking.The GOA created a fake law enforcement agency with a nifty website and an address that was nothing but an empty parking lot. Then, they applied for the military grade weapons through the 1033 program, which allows law enforcement agencies to obtain military gear that isn t being used.The DoD fell for the ruse hook, line, and sinker. Within a week, the fake cops were given $1.2 million worth of military-grade gear, including night vision goggles, simulated M-16A2 rifles, and pipe bomb equipment. They never did any verification, like visit our  location,  and most of it was by email,  said Zina Merritt, director of the GAO s defense capabilities and management team, which ran the operation.  It was like getting stuff off of eBay. Following the shooting death of Michael Brown in 2014, protests broke out in the city of Ferguson. Americans were shocked to see police respond with gear that is normally only seen in the hands of the armed forces. Obama responded to the public outcry by rolling back the Clinton-era 1033 program through an executive order, putting strict oversight in place through a Defense Department and Justice Department working group. However, the group has not met since Trump took office, which is why the GAO decided to launch its sting operation.The DoD didn t have a comment and this colossal screw-up, but they did promise to beef up their verification process. They promised to at least try to visit the agencies who apply for these weapons to make sure they actually exist before shipping them a load of M-16s.

1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"Tuesday, Trump s nominee to lead the DOJ s criminal division goes before the Senate Judiciary for confirmation. He will likely face questions about his time representing Alfa Bank, a major Russian financial institution headed up by owners with ties with Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. Brian Benczkowski told Congress less than a week ago about his ties to the bank, in advance of his testimony, as reported by the New York Times.Apparently Benczkowski was previously  unable  to disclose his former employer because of a confidentiality agreement he d signed. He has since gotten a waiver to do so. Questions from the senators should likely include whether or not Benczkowski intended to tell them about his Russian contacts in the absence of such a waiver. Anticipating this line of questioning, the letter he sent Congress on July 19 indicated that he would now be able to discuss the fact and scope of the representation at the hearing. In part:Your staff has indicated that the committee may wish to question me at my hearing regarding the fact and scope of my work for Alfa Bank. As I am sure you understand, ethical considerations prohibit me from disclosing confidential legal advice or any other information protected by the attorney-client privilege under any circumstances.Owners representing about 75% interest in the bank, Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan, sued BuzzFeed News in May over a dossier they published tying the bank to Putin, Trump, and the 2016 election. Although that suit is ongoing, a spokesman for BuzzFeed called it a  shameless attempt to bully and intimidate  the news outlet. He cited the fact that  the allegations contained in the dossier were presented to successive presidents and remain under active investigation by intelligence agencies and Congress,  and the reports are still published.Hopefully, the committee takes into account the peripherals of Benczkowski s contacts, rather than the simple fact of his employment. The fact that Trump   who undoubtedly already knows everything the committee may find in their hearing and more   still tapped someone with extensive ties to Russia despite the ongoing investigation speaks volumes about his brazen attitude toward both Congress and the country itself.Featured image via Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images", Trump’s Pick For Head Of DOJ Criminal Division Represented Russian Banks With Putin Ties
1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s conflicts of interest are finally starting to create some major problems for the undeserving POTUS.When Trump was elected, most Americans were up in arms over the fact that Trump has so many messy, shady business ties and would clearly be trying to exploit his position in the White House for his own personal gain. Judging from what we ve seen from Trump and his corrupt family in these short six months of his presidency, we had every right to be worried   Trump has been trying to profit off of his new role from the second he stepped into the White House.Fortunately, members of Congress are standing up to this unethical behavior. On Monday, a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives proposed legislation that would prevent the government from renting rooms at any of Trump s hotels for official business matters. In a statement that pretty much reflects exactly how most Americans feel about this, Representative Don Beyer of Virginia said: Donald Trump should not be allowed to line his or his family s pockets with taxpayer dollars. Exactly! Rep. Beyer also stated that these amendments to a spending bill were critical due to Trump s unprecedented failure to divest from his business, and the ongoing entanglement between the Trump Organization and the White House.  This is following a similar motion that happened last month, when the attorneys general of Maryland and the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit that stated it was a constitutional violation to make government payments to Trump s businesses.The White House has yet to comment on this, but we can all be certain that Trump is going to have a colossal meltdown over it. Every time someone calls out his unethical actions   even if they re 100 percent true   Trump acts like a toddler and has a meltdown.

Most Republicans are hesitant to criticize them as a group, since they already have enough problems with public perception regarding their attitudes on issues of race. Therefore, it s a pretty powerful thing when the Congressional Black Caucus comes out with a major position, which they did on Monday.This group of lawmakers has banded together to take a very controversial stand, which is to call for the resignation of the racist Keebler elf who likes to call himself America s Attorney General, Jeff Sessions. They said in a statement: Attorney General Sessions is unfit to serve as the top law enforcement official in the nation and should resign from the position immediately. As the old saying goes,  fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.  Attorney General Sessions is treating Congress and the American people like fools. The Caucus voted on whether or not to publicly call for Sessions to step down even before the Washington Post revealed on Friday that, once again, Sessions had not been truthful under oath. The Post story alleges that United States intelligence listened in on phone calls held by Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, in which he explicitly said that he had conversations about the 2016 presidential campaign with Sessions, whom he met with repeatedly. Sessions has forcefully denied this while under oath.The Congressional Black Caucus went on to say of those revelations: Every day the Department of Justice prosecutes people for lying under oath, yet the man who leads the department has lied under oath on more than one occasion. Exactly. Forget resignation   Jeff Sessions needs to be prosecuted. If any of us did what he has done, we d be in prison for years. This man definitely should not be any kind of law enforcement officer, much less the top one. He is a disgrace to the Constitution and to the Department of Justice. Hopefully, the Congressional Black Caucus s influence moves others to respond to Sessions  grave transgressions and lawbreaking in kind.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Congressional Black Caucus: Jeff Sessions Has Got To GO
1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"Unlike the United States, Germany has both a President and a Chancellor. The President is nothing more than a figurehead, of course; it is Chancellor Angela Merkel actually runs the nation. At any rate, Germany s current President, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, has come out on television to tell everyone just how he feels about Donald Trump.Speaking to a German television host, President Steinmeier says that he is  irritated  by Trump. Of course, since Germany is a staunch ally of the United States, he was careful in his wording and quick to recognize the relationship between the two nations, especially during the crucial rebuilding of Europe in the post World War II era. Steinmerier says: Our economic development would not have happened without the Marshall Plan. In this respect, I advise us not to throw everything overboard, even though I admit that I am irritated about a lot of things. He went on to essentially say he knows that most Americans are just as horrified by Trump as he is: Not all of America has forgotten the transatlantic relationship, and therefore I believe that within American politics, there will be corrections made to what we are now seeing. Of course, this is how you rebuke someone without even mentioning their name. Further, these remarks should come as no surprise, since Trump and German Chanecellor Angela Merkel have long had a frosty relationship. Like decent people everywhere, she was appalled by Trump s campaign trail behavior, and things have only gotten worse since Trump took office. When Merkel visited the White House, Trump actually gave her a bill for NATO, apparently in an attempt to keep his promise that he d make our allies pay up before offering  our protection. He also had the audacity to joke about Merkel being wiretapped. And then of course, there was the fact that Trump was way out of his league at the G 20, the G 7 and NATO Summits.All in all, the world cannot wait to be rid of Trump.

1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"Trumpers are rejoicing over the escalating activities of Immigration and Customs Enforcement because of their wholly misguided belief that undocumented immigrants do nothing but sit here, in the U.S., illegally soaking up every dollar that should go to actual Americans. That mentality has spawned five squillion allegations about the behavior of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which has gotten increasingly brazen, and even abusive, since Trump s election.One ICE agent has apparently had enough, and he s speaking out. Jonathan Blitzer, a contributing writer to The New Yorker, got in touch with this agent (who would only allow these details to be published under condition of anonymity) who finds himself increasingly alarmed by the culture shift at the agency.He s particularly angry about ICE s specific targeting of children who entered the country as unaccompanied minors years ago. Those children were placed with families and allowed to attend school here, hopefully so they could make themselves into contributing members of society. He told Blitzer something shocking: That they re going after these children literally because they can, even though there s no real policy for what to do with them after they re rounded up. The plan is to take them back into custody, and then figure it out. I don t understand it. We re doing it because we can, and it bothers the hell out of me.The whole idea is targeting kids. I know that technically they meet the legal definition of being adults. Fine. But if they were my kids travelling in a foreign country, I wouldn t be O.K. with this. We re not doing what we tell people we do. If you look [at] next month, or at the end of this month, at the people in custody, it s people who ve been here for years. They re supposed to be in high school. This isn t some rookie who s only been with the agency for a few months or a year, and probably hasn t fully assimilated into the culture and become a cold-hearted, contemptuous, power-drunk officer. This is veteran officer who has been in federal immigration enforcement since the Clinton administration.He talks about what things were like before Trump: ICE used to look at the full circumstances of a deportation case before making decisions. He feels that the job of the agency is not to judge the people they re detaining, and yet, many ICE agents are doing just that now, and that s part of the problem. Their contempt is growing by leaps and bounds and it s affecting how the agency runs as a whole (which Trump fans no doubt love).While this particular agent was heavily critical of Obama and what he saw as micromanaging from Obama s administration, there s so much now that s gone that it s really no wonder individual agents seem hungry to arrest and remove as many people as possible   even if those people are children. It sounds like they re becoming single-minded about it.And this agent is also upset about the use of resources. Our immigration system is already badly clogged, and has been for a long time. ICE is pretty much intentionally making that worse. We still have to make decisions based on a responsible use of the government s resources you can t lock everybody up, We re putting more people into that overburdened system just because we can. There s just this school of thought that, well, we can do what we want. This is Trump s America. This is what the Trumpers want   they want  the other  gone and they don t care how it happens or who that  other  is, let alone what it s going to cost us. The fact that ICE is targeting children who were specifically placed with families here, and who should be attending high school now, is just flat-out vile.

1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner has found himself at the focus of the Russia scandal which has gripped the administration. It s always the quiet ones you have to worry about, as they say. Kushner released an 11-page statement earlier in which he appeared to throw Donald Trump Jr. under the bus.Then Kush (I can call you Kush, right?) spoke for two hours in a closed-door session with Senate Intelligence Committee staff members investigating Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election. After that, Kushner proceeded to talk to reporters, but didn t take any questions. I did not collude with Russia and I do not know of anyone else in the campaign who did so,  Kushner said outside the White House.Kushner insisted that he has been  fully transparent  which is totally untrue, according to the written statement he issued just hours earlier.In that statement, Kushner said he had four contacts with Russians during the presidential campaign and transition and declared that none of them were improper, even though they were not disclosed previously.Even most Republicans agree that Donald Trump Jr. should not have held that controversial meeting with a Russian lawyer, which was attended by Kushner and former campaign manager Paul Manafort.According to Kushner, it s all cool because he said he did not read emails that showed that Junior enthusiastically accepted the meeting with the idea that he would receive damaging information about Hillary Clinton.Kushner went on to deny that Russians financed some of his business interests in the private sector. However, it s been revealed that Trump s son-in-law bought part of old New York Times building from a Soviet-born oligarch who is allegedly tied to money laundering. There are many other instances we could cite, too. Like, for example, Kush s meeting with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov. That bank is sanctioned so it s alarming that he would even take the 30 minute meeting.But since Kush feigns to be transparent, he can prove that right now.USA Today reports:Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., called on Kushner to testify in public under oath, and said his written statement raised more questions about his relationships with Russians. He noted that the White House senior adviser  has repeatedly concealed information about his personal finances and meetings with foreign officials. There should be no presumption that he is telling the whole truth in this statement. At the very least, said Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Va., the transcript from Kushner s meeting with staff members should be made public.  Make everything as transparent as possible,  Manchin told reporters. All of my actions were proper,  he said outside the White House. So, the four undisclosed meetings (that we know about so far) were  proper ?When Kushner sought top-secret security clearance which would give him access to some of the nation s most closely guarded secrets, he was required to disclose all encounters with foreign government officials over the last seven years, but he failed to do so. You know, because he s so  transparent.

1,Fake,"July 24, 2017",News,"The American Legislative Exchange Council, otherwise known as ALEC, is a corporate-funded project whose agenda is to give Republicans even more of an advantage, starting at the very top and working their way down. Part of their right-wing agenda now is to go 104 years back in time and get rid of an elected Senate, instead reverting to Senators being decided by deals between wealthy campaign donors, corporate lobbyists, and legislators.Trying to bring an end to representative democracy in the US isn t a particularly new idea, it s one that has been getting proposed for decades, however, nobody has come as close to making it a reality as ALEC. In fact, last year they circulated a document entitled Draft Resolution Recommending Constitutional Amendment Restoring Election of US Senators to the Legislatures of the Sovereign States, something that will most likely be discussed at great length at ALEC s annual meeting this week. If the article is approved by ALEC members, becomes part of their official agenda and is eventually instated, it will take a step backward and return the US to the corrupt and undemocratic practice of state legislators bartering off Senate seats, which was ended in 1913.When you take a look at that document you can tell these guys aren t fooling around, as it goes almost immediately to their ultimate goal:Section 1. The seventeenth article of amendment to the Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.Section 2. Senators shall be elected exclusively by the State legislature, upon a majority vote of legislators present and voting in a joint session. If a vacancy shall exist for more than one hundred-eighty days, then the Governor shall appoint the Senator to serve the remainder of the vacant term. This procedure may not be modified by state initiative or referendum.Section 3. State legislatures may issue instructions to, or recall, their Senators at any time.By doing this, Congress will become more representative of corporations than citizens of the United States and also the imbalance in the upper chamber would almost certainly grow. Fortunately, overturning the Seventeenth Amendment would be no easy task, but it is a terrifying prospect that there are organizations trying to stifle democracy in the United States of America.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"," Republicans Are Trying To Destroy The Senate As We Know It, Taking Away Your Vote — Here’s How"

Along with this, though, almost always comes some kind of amazing example of hypocrisy in their ranks.These examples pop up pretty regularly, and here we have another one.Fifty-four-year-old David Narromore is a dentist in Kingsport, Tennessee. He is also the chairman of that state s Republican Party. Narromore has been up to some decidedly un-family values like behavior of late, though, and now he might be going to jail for it. In the men s restroom at a Belk s Department Store, a most disturbing incident involving Narromore happened, and a store employee contacted police. Apparently, Mr. Narromore was exposing himself to the employee, who just happened to be a loss prevention officer using the restroom in the stall next to Narromore.Narromore went well beyond the usual toe-tapping that happens in this case here, too. He decided it would be a good idea to stretch his foot into the unidentified employee s stall and start massaging the other man s foot with his own. As if that weren t bad enough, Narromore also whipped his d*ck out for the poor innocent employee as well. This is what prompted the call to the cops.The employee then kept Narromore in the store in his office until police arrived. Narromore was taken into custody   but not without a fight. He decided to resist arrest, refusing to comply with orders from police when they attempted to handcuff him. He became physically combative, and they had to tase him. When that didn t work, officers were forced to take Narromore to the ground in order to cuff him and take him away. He spent the night in a cell, right where he belonged, despite his efforts to make sure that didn t happen. After posting bail in the amount of $2,250, he was let out of the joint the next day. He is charged with resisting arrest and indecent exposure.Of course, the Tennessee GOP has relieved Narromore of his duties after this embarrassing dust-up. Tennessee GOP Communications Director Trent Watson says of the incident: Dr. Narramore is clearly going through some personal issues. We wish him well as he attempts to deal with (his) personal struggles. Ah, yes. In Republican circles, being gay is wrong, so that means that when one has a  lapse,  it s just  personal issues.  Maybe if this guy wasn t such a repressed closet case, he wouldn t be committing sex crimes in public restrooms. If you people weren t so archaic and hateful when it comes to LGBTQ people, the people in your ranks who are repressed homosexuals wouldn t wind up doing this sort of thing and continuously embarrassing your party.Maybe the  issues  here have to do with the wrong-headed, hateful, and dangerous views of the GOP when it comes to homosexuality, not the people who are gay, repress it due to said views, and wind up in the slammer over it.Then again, this guy, as a professional Republican, deserves no sympathy, as his hypocrisy is off the charts with this one. He pushes politicians and laws that harm LGBTQ people, then gets caught trolling for gay sex in a public men s room.

The deal wasn t a very good one because Indiana taxpayers will shoulder some of the costs of Trump s unfortunate attempt to promote himself. At the same Carrier factory where Trump boasted of having crafted the deal to save jobs, it has begun laying off workers. 338 employees were just laid off. One female employee did an interview with The New Yorker and she didn t hold back.Brenda Darlene Battle, 55, worked at the Carrier Corporation for the past 25 years. Trump came in there to the factory last December and blew smoke up our asses,  Battle told The New Yorker.  He wasn t gonna save those jobs. And, if that s the case, he would have saved us and Rexnord, a company around the corner from us that makes parts. She said that Trump supporters at the factory have gone quiet since the layoffs began. We had a mix of Trump supporters and Clinton supporters at the factory, I d say. The ones that really supported him are quiet right now,  she said.  Some of them got let go yesterday, too. She said that  some of them wore the hats. Not anymore, though,  in reference to the red  Make America Great Again  hats. Personally, I think the President is a  rubber room  politician. He s crazy. He needs a straitjacket. He s in there for his self. He s not in there to help America keep jobs. Because if he was we wouldn t be in the predicament that we re in every day,  she continued.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions won t find much support from voters on this as support to legalize marijuana has risen to an all time high.Sessions leads the amateur president s Task Force on Crime Reduction and Public Safety which is expected to release a report next week. Critics are concerned that the report will try to link weed to violent crime and recommend tougher sentences. And there is no link to violent crime and smoking weed.The Hill reports:Sessions sent a memo in April updating the U.S. Attorney s Offices and Department of Justice Department (DOJ) component heads on the work of the task force, which he said would be accomplished through various subcommittees. In the memo, Sessions said he has asked for initial recommendations no later than July 27. Task Force subcommittees will also undertake a review of existing policies in the areas of charging, sentencing, and marijuana to ensure consistency with the Department s overall strategy on reducing violent crime and with Administration goals and priorities,  he wrote.Clearly, critics aren t wrong to be concerned of Sessions implementing tougher sentences for smoking weed. The task force revolves around reducing violent crime and Sessions and other DOJ officials have been out there over the last month and explicitly the last couple of weeks talking about how immigration and marijuana increases violent crime,  Inimai Chettiar, the director of the Brennan Center s Justice Program said.Sessions is going after weed, you know, because the  war on drugs  worked out so well last time.Back in May, he penned a letter to Congressional leaders. I believe it would be unwise for Congress to restrict the discretion of the Department to fund prosecutions, particularly in the midst of an historic drug epidemic and potentially long-term uptick in violent crime,  Sessions wrote in the letter.We re not sure what weed has to do with the opioid epidemic sweeping across America, a problem which the Trump administration has failed to address.On Wednesday, Sessions managed to outrage both Democrats and Republicans with his controversial plans to increase civil asset forfeiture.Local law enforcement leaders don t feel that a crackdown is necessary. From a practitioner s point of view, marijuana is not a drug that doesn t have some danger to it, but it s not the drug that s driving violent crime in America,  said Ronal Serpas, the former superintendent of the New Orleans Police Department who co-chairs Law Enforcement Leaders to Reduce Crime and Incarceration. That s not the drug with which we see so much death and destruction on the streets of America. Crack and powdered cocaine, heroin and opioids is where we re seeing people die on street corners fighting over territory or control,  he added.The states rights issue that Republicans have vigorously touted seems to go against what Sessions is about to do.While on the campaign trail, Trump vowed to leave marijuana legalization up to the states but he appears to have flip-flopped on that issue, too.Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images.", Trump Administration Gets Ready To Come After Cannabis (DETAILS)

There s a lot of disinformation,  Scaramucci said.  Somebody said to me the other day   I don t want to say who   if the Russians actually hacked this situation and spilled out those emails, you would have never seen it. You would have never had any evidence of them. Meaning that they re super confident in their deception skills and hacking. But our intelligence agencies have confirmed that Russian did, in fact, meddle in our election by attacking our democratic institutions by hacking, which can be traced back to the perpetrators by our own professional cyber security experts. Basically, Scaramucci is claiming that the Russians are too good to get caught by us. That s simply not true.And Tapper was quick to call Scaramucci out for it, but not before he slammed Scaramucci for citing an anonymous source. Wait, wait, wait,  Tapper chimed in.  I don t know who this anonymous person is. And then Scaramucci demonstrated that, just like Trump, he can t keep his mouth shut and is a leaker. How about it s the president, Jake,  Scaramucci replied.  He called me from Air Force One and basically said to me,  This is   maybe they did it, maybe they didn t do it. Wow. That s truly pathetic.Tapper proceeded to tear Scaramucci apart for being Trump s yes-man instead of accepting the analysis of our own intelligence agencies and Trump s own Director of National Intelligence. This is exactly the issue!  Tapper said.  We have experts, the U.S. intelligence agencies [are] unanimous, both Obama appointees and Trump appointees   the director of national intelligence, the head of the National Security Agency, the head of the FBI. I mean, all of these intelligence experts, saying, Russia hacked the election, they tried to interfere in the election. President Trump is contradicting it and you re siding with President Trump! Indeed, it certainly appears Scaramucci is just shilling for Trump and he even proceeded to whine about Tapper s observation, leading Tapper to ask,  Don t you owe a duty to the truth? Scaramucci then claimed that he doesn t know what the truth is because:  I don t have the information in front of me. But he didn t even bother to get the information. Instead, he got talking points from Trump and merely parroted them on television like a good little lapdog.Here s the video via YouTube.Scaramucci is already making it clear that he is untrustworthy. He just threw our intelligence community under the bus and demonstrated that he is the kind of leaker that Trump whines about. He couldn t even stop himself from bragging about how Trump himself was the anonymous source who told him Russia didn t hack us.

It seemed as though Trump was purposely trying to throw his Russian scandal in everyone s face, ignoring the severity of the entire situation. Fortunately, director of the National Security Agency Adm.

But that s not working, and they know it. They just can t admit it. To make up for the shortfalls caused by these tax cuts, they now want to effectively raise taxes on certain other people: Their opponents, the Democrats.Their current tax reform plan calls for eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes. But wait, you might ask, how is that only raising taxes on Democrats? Doesn t that raise taxes on everyone? Well, yes, but this would disproportionately affect blue states   specifically, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and California.These are the states where taxpayers get the biggest deductions. Therefore, these people would see their taxes go up considerably more than people living in red states. These four states have high taxes, but they also have high property values and high cost of living. No red state ranks in the top 10 for this particular deduction. One might say that the low taxes in red states are better anyway, but then why is it that blue states tend to be more wealthy and prosperous?It s a well-known fact that blue states generally subsidize red states at the federal level. They send more dollars to the federal government than they receive. Red states, on the other hand, take in a lot more and pay a lot less to the federal government. Essentially, red states live off the backs of blue states while whining up one side and down the other about socialism and having to pay to subsidize other people.The national average for this particular deduction is just over $11,000, but the four states listed above all deduct more than $17,000. What better way to ensure that the residents of these states pay even more for the poverty in red states than to eliminate thousands of dollars of deductions?Republican lawmakers from these blue states are pushing back very hard on this, because it is, in effect, selective tax increase on people who actually do need to see their taxes cut. However, other Republicans are claiming that eliminating this deduction will actually allow Congress to lower other taxes.Oh, please. It won t work that way, not because it can t (this would raise enough money to pay for lower income taxes, if done right), but because Republicans are incapable of coming up with a plan that s actually beneficial to low- and middle-income Americans.Here s a novel idea: Why don t they eliminate certain tax breaks and loopholes that only apply to the top 1 percent, instead of one that the shrinking middle class benefits from too? Oh wait, they can t do that. They ll lose their rich backers if they do.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Republicans Want To Tax Democratic States More To Pay For Tax Cuts For The Rich
1,Fake,"July 22, 2017",News,"If Donald Trump thinks being president means he can t be prosecuted for his crimes, he should think again.As it turns out, Special Prosecutor Robert Mueller has the power to indict Trump if he has enough evidence proving that Trump committed a criminal act such as colluding with Russia in an effort to win the 2016 Election. Donald Trump s son Trump Jr. has already demonstrated that Trump s campaign met with a Kremlin-linked Russian lawyer and a former Soviet Intelligence officer in order to get dirt to use against Hillary Clinton, which is, indeed, the very definition of collusion.Mueller s power to indict is confirmed by a 56-page legal memo written by Ronald Rotunda, a conservative professor of constitutional law and ethics, who was hired as part of Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr s team during the Bill Clinton presidency.According to the 1998 memo, which was obtained by the New York Times,It is proper, constitutional, and legal for a federal grand jury to indict a sitting president for serious criminal acts that are not part of, and are contrary to, the president s official duties. In this country, no one, even President Clinton, is above the law.That means no sitting president is above the law, including Trump.Watergate special counsel, Leon Jaworski, came to the same conclusion in 1974.The only reason why Jaworski and Starr declined to indict President Nixon and President Clinton is because they chose to let impeachment proceedings play out instead.Well, Republicans have thus far done everything they can to protect Trump from being impeached. So it appears Mueller may not have a choice but to indict Trump if Republicans continue to refuse to do their public duty.Even the Supreme Court has ruled that sitting presidents are not above the law by deciding in 1997 that a lawsuit against Clinton for misconduct prior to becoming president can move forward. And since Trump was not president when he and his campaign colluded with Russia, that makes his misconduct open to indictment, along with any other crimes he committed prior to taking office. That means if Mueller digs through Trump s finances and finds other crimes, Trump could face an indictment for those as well. If there is no recourse against the president, if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws, he will be above the law,  Rotunda further wrote. If public policy and the Constitution allow a private litigant to sue a sitting president for acts that are not part of the president s official duties (and are outside the outer perimeter of those duties), and that is what Clinton v. Jones squarely held, then one would think that an indictment is constitutional because the public interest in criminal cases is greater. In short, Trump is in deep shit and he can t blame Hillary Clinton to get out of it. Not even Republicans can dispute the Starr memo. Republicans not only supported Starr s investigation, it was a conservative legal mind who wrote the memo.So unless Republicans proceed with impeachment proceedings to get to the bottom of this once and for all, Robert Mueller must indict Trump. Because it is clear that Republicans won t punish Trump for breaking the law and violating the Constitution.Featured Image: Addicting Info Archive"," BAD NEWS For Trump: Memo Proves He Is Not Above The Law, Can Be Indicted"

Of course, we all already know that Putin has power over the government from the outside. Trump is his puppet and he s pulling the strings from Moscow.Coulter goes even further by claiming that Trump is  better  than Ronald Reagan. Keep in mind that Reagan would never have colluded with Russia to win an election. He certainly would not have allowed Russia to dictate what he does as president. Reagan is rolling in his grave right now because of what Trump has done and is doing.As the evidence continues to stack up against Trump, Republicans are just letting him get away with ignoring the Constitution and flouting the law. He has repeatedly lied to the American people, repeatedly obstructed justice, and is using the White House to enrich himself and his family. And they are willing to let him burn down our democracy and humiliate our nation as long as it means they get to enact their political agenda and remain in power.The fact that conservatives like Coulter actually want Putin to be vice-president should scare the hell out of every American, especially those who constantly claim to be  patriots.

He s genuinely a wonderful human being and I think as members of Congress get to know him better and get comfortable with him, they re going to let him lead them to the right things for the American people.

That should come as no surprise, because Trump has spent the last several months insulting the FBI and intelligence agencies because he s bitter about the Russian scandal. So it s pretty hilarious that this tweet, straight from the Trump campaign, has resurfaced:That s right   then-Trump surrogate Sarah Huckabee Sanders   who has just been promoted to White House Press Secretary due to Sean Spicer s resignation   previously trashed the very  losing  behavior that Trump has been doing for months now. Sanders had posted this in November (right before the election) in response to speculation that a few FBI agents were playing politics.We would honestly love to see Trump defend his behavior now. He s spent so much time trashing federal investigators and firing everyone who might be a threat to him in the Russia investigation, it s pretty much impossible to believe he could be innocent after all this.Trump not only fired Comey, but he has attacked the ex-FBI Director, referring to him as a  nut job  who is  not a smart guy.  Now he s threatening to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller if Mueller investigates his finances and businesses. And unfortunately, Sanders has taken a similar attitude now that she is closer to Trump. Completely forgetting about her tweet from November, she more recently stated that Comey is guilty of  atrocities. Whether she stands by it today or not, Sanders  tweet is telling in its exposure of an administration with no integrity.

That may well put Trump at war with the NRA, because the NRA is likely to see this as a betrayal of sorts.In 2012, Scaramucci was very clear in his position on gun laws, and they do not match what the NRA wants to see in the White House at all:Image via TwitterHe also told all of Twitter that he s always supported strong gun laws. The NRA hates any gun laws   in fact, they like to push lawmakers to loosen them in response to mass shootings:Image via TwitterSo, of course, NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch isn t exactly thrilled with Scaramucci s appointment.

During these investigations, some news has come to light that Republicans have tried to use to discredit Obama, some of his officials, and thus, the entire Russia scandal. It seems, though, that some Republicans spread some fake news about all of this, probably to help Donald Trump.The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes, has maintained that Rice improperly unmasked the names of members of Trump s transition team caught up in incidental surveillance of Russian nationals. However, Senator Richard Burr, a Republican and the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has something to say about that, and it s pretty damning for Nunes: The unmasking thing was all created by Devin Nunes, and I ll wait to go through our full evaluation to see if there was anything improper that happened.  [emphasis mine]So Devin Nunes lied? It certainly looks like that s what Burr is saying. While Burr acknowledged that American citizens on Trump s transition team were unmasked, and that information did become public when it shouldn t have, he seems to believe that Nunes was making things up when he accused Susan Rice of improper unmasking.That goes with earlier reports that Nunes got his information from the White House, which has had a bone to pick with the entire Obama administration since Jan. 20. Nunes was vague in discussing the unmasking, apparently because the information was classified (but maybe also because he knew he was lying).Most other lawmakers who have seen these records, and have seen the unmasking, said there was no evidence of wrongdoing on Rice s part, or anyone else s. But Nunes made it his mission to discredit Rice (and thus, Obama) to the point where he could at least accuse the Obama administration of breaking the law.The problem with Nunes  involvement with this investigation is that he was always more interested in clearing Trump than he was in actually investigating the fact that a hostile foreign power successfully meddled in our election in 2016.

It s not just Jared, but a senior White House adviser, too. You see, most of us don t simply forget about millions of dollars, or thousands, or hundreds. In fact, for a guy who owes a fuckton of money, we re pretty sure he didn t  forget  about it either.On Friday, Jared and a senior White House adviser released a revised version of his personal financial disclosure which now shows that his initial filing omitted dozens of assets, including commercial real estate, bonds issued by the New York water and sewer authority, a personal art collection and a New Jersey liquor license, the Wall Street Journal reports.Hey, we re not talking about one or two assets that Jared omitted from his earlier form; we re talking about 77 of them.Ivanka Trump s form hasn t yet been certified by the ethics office, as required by law. Details schmetails! Jared and Ivanka have followed each of the required steps in their transition from private citizens to federal officials,  Jamie Gorelick, a lawyer for the couple, said in a statement.Drain the Swamp, Donald Trump said, then he filled it up with his swampy family members:The new disclosure shows Mr. Kushner and Ms. Trump collectively hold between $206 million and $760 million in assets. Mr. Kushner s initial disclosure put the value of their assets between $240 million and $740 million. The changes in values may reflect divestments since the last filing and the broad range of valuation for assets.Well now! That s not a lot of money. Oh wait, Don Fox, who served as the ethics office s general counsel from 2008 to 2013 and as acting director from 2011 until 2013, says otherwise.Fox said the number of omissions on Jared Kushner s initial form was unusually high.  That strikes me as a lot,  he said.You don t say.The Wall Street Journal reports:In his initial disclosure, Mr. Kushner didn t identify business relationships with Goldman Sachs Group and billionaires George Soros and Peter Thiel through a real-estate tech startup called Cadre that Mr. Kushner co-founded and currently partly owns, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year. An investment in Cadre valued at between $5 million and $25 million was included on the new disclosure, which showed Mr. Kushner  intended to resign  from his position with Cadre in January but didn t do so until May.According to Kushner s lawyer, it was simply  an administrative error.  We re sure his art collection valued at between $5 million and $25 million was merely an oversight, too. But, according to the lawyer, the art collection was just for  personal enjoyment,  and had nothing to do with investment purposes.And then there s the Kushner s $1 billion in loans that he failed to disclose previously. Those loans were from more than 20 lenders.It gets worse:Mr. Kushner has also filed revisions to a form required to obtain a security clearance that, in its initial form, didn t list contacts between him and foreign government officials. He subsequently submitted information about  over 100 calls or meetings with representatives of more than 20 countries,  Ms. Gorelick has said in a statement. Those contacts weren t made public.The Trump Crime Family s mounting conflicts of interest are being paraded out after more and more information is revealed.

According to the Washington Post:Ambassador Sergey Kislyak s accounts of two conversations with Sessions were intercepted by U.S. spy agencies, which monitor the communications of senior Russian officials both in the United States and in Russia. Sessions initially failed to disclose his contacts with Kislyak and then said that the meetings were not about the Trump campaign  A former official said that the intelligence indicates that Sessions and Kislyak had  substantive  discussions on matters including Trump s positions on Russia-related issues and prospects for U.S.-Russia relations in a Trump administration.Well, gee, we can t imagine why on earth Sessions neglected to mention his meetings with Kislyak on his SF-86. That was supposedly at the instruction of the FBI investigator conducting his background check, but it doesn t matter who did or did not tell him to do it. He still omitted a foreign contact who just happened to be Russian.But remember back in March, when he said this as he recused himself from the Russia investigation? I never had meetings with Russian operatives or Russian intermediaries about the Trump campaign. Ha! Nope.Then in January, he literally said he d never had any contact with the Russians at all. When called out for that, he said that he misunderstood the question about his foreign contacts during his Senate confirmation hearing. So his lies evolve as new information comes out.While U.S. officials cannot assert that what they learned about Kislyak s conversations with the Kremlin are 100 percent accurate, they now have something new to dig into when it comes to Jeff Sessions and his true ties to Russia.Recusal from the Russia probe is no longer enough (it really never was). Sessions now appears to have done everything he claimed he never did, including discuss Trump s position on Russia while the campaign was still going on. Not only is lying or deliberately omitting information on the SF-86 illegal, but he discussed matters of foreign policy as a member of a presidential candidate s campaign.

The shakeup had only begun. By the afternoon, Trump s personal lawyer Marc Kasowitz, also resigned after being demoted from heading the Russia defense and after, in the New York Times interview, Trump threatened special counsel Robert Mueller against going after Trump family finances.In an interview with MSNBC, Times reporter Peter Baker said this about Trump s legal team: People around him definitely are.

First of all, this guy is a good guy, he is a smart guy, a person of integrity. In fact, some of the lawyers have said to the president, in effect, if you didn t do anything wrong and we think you don t have anything to worry about in terms of the Russia investigation, then you should want Robert Mueller at your special counsel, because if he finds that, if that s his conclusion, it will have credibility on both sides of the aisle, so don t do that. Baker was proven right on Friday when Kasowitz left the team after it was announced that Ty Cobb would be heading the defense.This also points to a change in legal strategy, and that means that Mueller, if not outright fired, will be in the crosshairs. The goal will be to dig up any bit of dirt and any perceived conflict of interest to discredit him. All of that points to just one thing   guilt. If Trump, his family and his associates were innocent, they would, as his legal team said, welcome the investigation and discrediting Mueller would only put a cloud over any sort of exoneration.

Their Russia problems are mounting by the hour, and they refuse to acknowledge that there are problems surrounding all of this. To them, it s  fake news,  or a  hoax.  However, the facts bear things out differently, and it seems that there are now cracks in the Congressional public leadership.Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee, is fed up. He is now demanding that Donald Trump, Jr. and former 2016 Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort testify before his committee regarding the now infamous shady meeting between Donald Trump and the shady Russian lawyer who promised dirt on 2016 Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. In fact, this information is due, well, NOW. This demand sends a few signals to team Trump   most notably that they should not fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller under any circumstances, despite the fact that it seems that this seems to be what Trump s White House is laying the groundwork, so to speak, to do as we speak.Here is the tweet regarding Grassley s warning:Also, anyone who thinks that Senator Grassley and the rest of the Senate are not serious about this only needs to look at the warning that has already been given: Trump Jr. and Manafort will either follow orders, or be served with subpoenas that force them to comply. If they refuse, they will be held in contempt of Congress, which carries with it serious jail time.Even the cruel, craven creatures within the GOP are sick of Donald Trump s corruption and his scandal-ridden White House. They are angry that he staged a hostile takeover of their party, first with birtherism and giving them a permanently racist label all while decimating all efforts that were made to pretend the Republican Party isn t a hotbed of racism, and while turning their worlds upside down, and with it, the nation. It seems that old-timers like Grassley, who are clearly sick of Trump s bullshit, just might be the ones who could save the republic. All they need is a bit of courage.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images"," BREAKING: GOP Chairman Grassley Has Had Enough, DEMANDS Trump Jr. Testimony"
1,Fake,"July 21, 2017",News,"During  Made In America  week, an initiative which is supposedly to promote U.S. jobs and products, the Trump Organization is asking the federal government to grant dozens of special visas to foreign nationals to work at two of Donald Trump s private clubs in Florida, including his Mar-a-Lago resort, which he also calls the  Winter White House. it s like the former reality show star isn t even trying anymore.ABC reports:The company is seeking 35 waiters and waitresses at Mar-a-Lago along with 20 cooks and 15 maids. A listing is also posted for six cooks at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter. The jobs pay anywhere from $10.33 to $20.01 per hour. They run from Oct. 1 to May 31.On Thursday, requests for H-2B visas had been made public on the Department of Labor s website.The jobs would begin in October and end in May 2018 and pay a minimum of $10.33, $11.88 and $13.34 per hour but would be eligible for higher wages with overtime.The visa request filing came just days after the Trump administration announced it would offer an extra 15,000 temporary, seasonal work visas this budget year and we re sure that s not a coincidence at all.In mid-April, Trump signed an executive order which promotes the  Buy American and Hire American  idea.The EO states it is  to create higher wages and employment rates for workers in the United States. While we wouldn t have any problem with the hiring of foreign workers, Trump s hypocrisy is staggering.CNN reports:A CNN analysis of visa records in April found businesses run and owned by Trump and his adult children have been certified to hire at least 1,371 foreign visa workers since 2001.Just this past March, a winery owned by Eric Trump in Virginia applied to hire more foreign workers to pick grapes after being unable to find U.S. citizens willing to do the job.Trump s actions against immigration has farmers concerned because, they also hire foreign workers. If it gets worse, as one farmer put it, you re going to be living in a world without peaches maybe   at least California peaches.

1,Fake,"July 21, 2017",News,"Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), fresh off a brain cancer diagnosis that he is statistically unlikely to beat, is apparently all out of f*cks to give. Today, he tweeted an article in the opinion section of the Washington Post, calling it a  must-read.  The article in question?  Trump s breathtaking surrender to Russia. And the op-ed holds absolutely nothing back. Here are a couple of my favorite excerpts from the piece:But once again, President Trump   after extended personal contact with Vladimir Putin and the complete surrender to Russian interests in Syria   acts precisely as though he has been bought and sold by a strategic rival. The ignoble cutoff of aid to American proxies means that  Putin won in Syria,  as an administration official was quoted by The Post. Concessions without reciprocation, made against the better judgment of foreign policy advisers, smack more of payoff than outreach. If this is what Trump s version of  winning  looks like, what might further victory entail? The re- creation of the Warsaw Pact? The reversion of Alaska to Russian control? There is nothing normal about an American president s subservience to Russia s interests and worldview. It is not the result of some bold, secret, Nixonian foreign policy stratagem   the most laughable possible explanation. Does it come from Trump s bad case of authoritarianism envy? A fundamental sympathy with European right-wing, anti-democratic populism? An exposure to pressure from his checkered financial history? There are no benign explanations, and the worst ones seem the most plausible. The problem is the damage to U.S. interests done in the meantime. It now seems that the Russians   by meddling in a presidential election and by playing down such aggression   have achieved an intelligence coup beyond the dreams of the Soviet era. The result is an America strategically and morally disarmed.The fact that John McCain is posting such a strongly worded article about Trump s surrender to Russia is extremely telling, and begs the question: Behind closed doors, how many other Republicans feel this way? In public, it s obvious that Republicans feel they must present a united front against the Democratic Party and forces of the left. However, despite recent silence from #NeverTrump conservatives, it wasn t even a year ago that leadership figures such as Paul Ryan were dead set against him. Given the fact they are spineless, how much pressure will it take to get them to turn against him?If Donald Trump s numbers keep dropping, primarily among Republicans, I think you ll see it happen. And if that s the case, it might not take until 2018 to bring him down.Here s Senator McCain s tweet:Must-read @MJGerson @washingtonpost:  Trump s breathtaking surrender to #Russia  https://t.co/SkWocuF8dM  John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) July 21, 2017Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", John McCain Just Savaged Trump On Twitter (TWEET)
1,Fake,"July 21, 2017",News,"The whole world knows about the bombshell report of Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, and the former campaign manager for Donald Trump s 2016 presidential run, Paul Manafort, holding a secret meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya. Of course, despite how shady this is on its face, Team Trump s party line has been,  nothing to see here.  Well, it seems that there just might be something to see here, considering that Veselnitskaya actually once represented a Russian spy agency.Reuters reports that Veselnitskaya was involved in a bitter fight over elite, exclusive pieces of property in Moscow. Who was her client? The FSB, of course. Meaning, essentially, she was working for the Kremlin and Vladimir Putin. Supposedly, that connection ended in 2013 when Veselnitskaya won the case for the FSB. However, with the way Russia operates, once a Russian spy operative, always a Russian spy operative. Here is how Reuters describes the chain of events:Reuters could not find a record of when and by whom the lawsuit   which dates back to at least 2003   was first lodged. But appeal documents show that Rosimushchestvo, Russia s federal government property agency, was involved. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Veselnitskaya and her firm Kamerton Consulting represented  military unit 55002  in the property dispute, the documents show.Now, to play devil s advocate, it is very possible that Trump Jr. and the rest didn t know Veselnitskaya s history. That is possible, but certainly not probable, considering the fact that Trump Jr. himself has admitted that his family has been getting money from Russia to fund their business ventures for years. That makes it highly unlikely that the Trumps and those in their orbit weren t well aware of who this woman was, what her background was, and who she worked for.At the end of the day, this is a woman that never should have been allowed into this nation at all, and she definitely shouldn t have been anywhere an American presidential campaign. All of this is shady as hell, and hopefully Robert Mueller can get to the bottom of it while we still have a republic to save.Featured image via Flickr", Russian Lawyer At Trump Jr.’s Meeting Has Worked For Russian Spy Agency

A source familiar with the situation tells CNN that Christopher Buckley  expressed great dismay  at the announcement that the award would go to Hannity, who has spent a great deal of time insulting conservative intellectuals on Twitter, particularly since he became a strong supporter of Donald Trump.Indeed, Hannity is not an intellectual at all. He s a college dropout who peddles bullshit that should have gotten him kicked off the airwaves years ago. Meanwhile, William F. Buckley was a true conservative intellectual who loathed Trump.Buckley s son informed the Media Research Center of his disapproval and the group quietly removed Hannity s name from the gala on their website and decided not to give Hannity the award.They made the right decision.

1,Fake,"July 21, 2017",News,"As Donald Trump s legal team tries to dig up leverage to use against investigators and researches his pardon power, Kellyanne Conway is busy smearing anyone who is involved in the investigation.The Russia investigation has been heating up in recent days as more information continues to be revealed about Trump Jr s secret meeting with Russians and special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his team start looking at Trump s family finances, which will likely reveal all of Trump shady connections and dealings with Russian oligarchs.Obviously, Trump is very nervous about Mueller s investigation. He even warned Mueller not to look at his business dealings, which basically gave Mueller a reason to look there.During an appearance on Fox & Friends on Friday, Conway began laying the groundwork for Trump to have an excuse to fire Mueller and derail the investigation against him.She began by whining about how taxpayers are funding the investigation, which is hypocritical considering Republicans wasted millions of taxpayer dollars investigation Benghazi, a real witch hunt that lasted longer than even the 9/11 investigation. Where is this going?  Conway whined.  Are Americans comfortable with that, with the taxpayers funding this with this going off of all types of chutes and ladders? Then she accused Mueller and his team of being Democrats and Hillary Clinton partisans. Not only did these Democrat, presumably, lawyers donate a lot of money to the left side of the political aisle, one of them actually was a lawyer for the Clinton Foundation,  Conway said.Of course, Trump ass-kisser Steve Doocy jumped in to claim that there are all sorts of conflicts of interest and that members of Mueller s team should be forced to resign.Conway then launched a rant about how the  swamp  is out to get Trump and stop him from bringing  transparency  and  accountability  to Washington even though Trump has never been transparent and has never held himself accountable for anything he has ever said or done. Steve, here s the relevance of that   people should at least know it. Donald Trump went to Washington to disrupt and expose the system, just to blow that secret door off of its hinges and have more accountability and transparency in a system that thrives on the opposite. So the same applies here. Let s at least, you know, you re saying put on pressure   let s have a disinfectant, let s at least let the transparency and accountability speak for itself. It s relevant that people know what the motivations are, and that is not an attack on the team. That is what s fair is fair. Seriously.She then went on to accuse top Democratic members of the House and Senate investigations of spending more time on television than in hearings.Here s the video via Fox News.If Donald Trump fires Mueller he would be obstructing an investigation and telling the world that he has something to hide that he doesn t want investigators to find. He would basically be admitting that he s guilty. Of course, if Trump truly believed in accountability and transparency, he would admit that his campaign colluded with Russia and resign immediately.Featured Image: Screenshot", WATCH: Kellyanne Conway SMEARS Investigators To Give Trump An Excuse To Fire Them

Congemi claims to have been a life-long Democrat who switched to Republican after former President Barack Obama showed his support for gay marriage. Nevel, on the other hand, is white and has been running his campaign on the slogan  Unity through reparations,  and has also spoken out against gentrification and police brutality.Then there is the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, a socialist organization of white people who believe that the key to ending racial inequality is through reparations, but Congemi sees things from different angle. Mr. Nevel you and your people talk about reparations. The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama,  Congemi said at Tuesday s forum.  My advice to you, if you don t like it here in America, planes leave every hour from Tampa airport. Go back to Africa. Go back to Africa. Go back,  he continued, repeatedly pointing at the crowd and later making motions to exit.His statement was met with a combination of shock and disgust, with one woman in the crowd shouting  Get out of here!  after Congemi s comment about Barack Obama.Rick Kriseman, the sitting mayor of St. Petersburg, was also critical of the candidate s words, claiming on Wednesday that Congemi s statement was hateful, bigoted, and unacceptable toward black and gay Floridians. Jesse Nevel also saw the move as tactless, saying that Congemi s comment reflects a segment of my community. I ve met plenty of other people who feel that way. That s why I feel that it s important for those of us in the white community to take a public stand with reparations. In typical Republican fashion, Congemi tried to weasel his way out of the firestorm he had created, telling the Washington Post that he has  nothing against African Americans who are doing their best here in America,  and that his remarks were only aimed at those who are pushing for reparations. He even referred to Nevel as a  self-hating white man. The controversy doesn t seem to have slowed Congemi down, and he claims that anyone who believes he is racist simply misunderstood his comments. Even if he loses this time, he s not going to stop. I ll run again in 2019 and, God willing, if I m alive in 2021, I ll run then, too,  Congemi said.

1,Fake,"July 20, 2017",News,"Presidents are supposed to serve the American people, but Trump has made it clear that everyone works for him and he is not to be questioned or investigated or placed under scrutiny. Ever. Even when it comes to Russia, even when it comes to his severe lack of ethics and his Constitutional violations. We know about many of his conflicts of interest, which very well may break the law, and one would expect them to improve as time goes by. However, they re getting worse, not better.Historically, presidents do not go into office with the number of business interests Trump has. Previous presidents have placed what interests they do have into blind trusts, which means the president separates himself from them entirely. He has no influence, he gets no information. Trump? Not so much. Sure, his businesses are in a trust, but his sons manage it and they give him updates regularly.Even if they didn t, they re helping their father corrupt the Office of the President with his business. Trump s sons have pitched an idea for budget hotels called  American Idea,  and have gone so far as to sign letters of intent to build said hotels in economically depressed areas in red states.That isn t an  America first,  initiative so much as it s a way for Trump to expand his brand and boost his popularity among the plebes he otherwise ignores.(We all have a million dollars that says those hotels will hire foreign workers for cheap, as Mar a Lago in Florida just did.)Trump s presence at his golf clubs serves as promotion, and some of them (like Mar a Lago) are raking in the dough from increased membership fees and people willing to pay them in order to say they ve rubbed shoulders with him and other world leaders. His decision to roll back an environmental policy ensuring clean drinking water directly benefits his golf courses, which means he brings in even more money.The Trump International Hotel in D.C., situated in the historic Old Post Office building, isn t supposed to belong to any government officials. The reason Trump can have such an interest in it is supposedly because his business is in a trust, so he technically doesn t have an interest. Or something. Regardless, the hotel is supposed to be donating profits from foreign officials who stay there to the U.S. Treasury, but Trump said that asking foreign officials to identify themselves as such would  diminish the guest experience. So he s directly profiting from foreign officials who stay there, either to curry favor with him or because they think it d be rude to stay with a competitor. It s probably both.Trump was obviously corrupt before before he was even elected   he s known this whole time how to milk campaigns and how to milk his office for all its worth, so that when he leaves he s richer than ever. During his campaign, he made heavy use of his own properties. That might make sense, but the law reveals just how he lined his pockets with campaign donations.Federal election law requires a campaign to pay fair market value for goods and services bought from a candidate s own businesses. Most candidates with their own business interests wind up spending one to three percent of their total spending on their businesses. Trump s spending was above 10 percent. There s no way that was an accident.Trump is corrupt. He knows it. We all know it. That s why he says that the president isn t subject to ethics laws   he s trying to build the case that he can do what he wants because he s the president and we re not.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images", Corruption: Here’s How Donald Trump Is Breaking The Law And Profiting From The Presidency
1,Fake,"July 20, 2017",News,"While Donald Trump hasn t exactly made an admission of guilt in the Russian scandal, but in a shocking story that just broke in the Washington Post, he s at least privately entertaining the idea that he will be prosecuted and possibly found guilty. Now he s asking if he can pardon family members, staff and even himself.Trump has asked his advisers about his power to pardon aides, family members and even himself in connection with the probe, according to one of those people. A second person said Trump s lawyers have been discussing the president s pardoning powers among themselves.Trump s legal team declined to comment on the issue. But one adviser said the president has simply expressed a curiosity in understanding the reach of his pardoning authority, as well as the limits of Mueller s investigation. This is not in the context of,  I can t wait to pardon myself,  a close adviser said.Source: Washington PostThis report comes in the same day a New York Times interview was published with Trump. In the interview, he appeared to threaten Special Counselor Robert Mueller if Mueller dared look into Trump s personal finances:Asked if Mr. Mueller s investigation would cross a red line if it expanded to look at his family s finances beyond any relationship to Russia, Mr. Trump said,  I would say yes.  He would not say what he would do about it.  I think that s a violation. Look, this is about Russia. Mueller didn t care, though. On the same day the interview was printed, it was revealed that Mueller s office is indeed investigating Trump s businesses, which may be why the sudden interest in Trump pardoning everyone around him, including himself.As for whether he can do that, well, the Constitution and history are unclear. No President has tried to pardon himself. Nixon thought about it before he resigned and his lawyer advised him that it was within his realm of authority. Note that a president doesn t have to wait till there are convictions to grant pardons.So what would happen if Trump attempted a self-pardon? First, some pardon fundamentals: Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the U.S. Constitution gives the president the power to  grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.  Pardons thus can only cover federal criminal offenses and cannot thwart an impeachment (which technically is not a criminal prosecution anyway). .The prosecutor s argument, while much more complicated, is a stronger one. First, a textual argument: The word  pardon  means something inherently bilateral, something that a sovereign bestows upon a subject. Consider more colloquially that you can beg someone else s pardon, but you never seek or receive one from yourself. While there is admittedly no explicit limitation on self-pardons, there is no need for one, because a self-pardon is by definition not a  pardon.  Other examples show that the pardon power is subject to inherent limitations like this. For instance, the law is clear that a pardon cannot be prospective   it can only reach offenses committed before the pardon is issued   but that limit is not spelled out in the Constitution either. It is implicit in the definition of a  pardon  as opposed to a suspension of the law.Source: Foreign PolicyWhether or not it can be done, it would set a very bad precedence and one that even the most partisan Republicans in Congress would find toxic. It could also be very bad for Trump s businesses.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images", BREAKING REPORT: Trump Is Terrified; Asking Lawyers If He Could Pardon Himself

Now he has a very strongly worded message for Congress   he wants them to do something about the monster in the White House or he ll stop writing them checks. In fact, it might be too late.Florida Cuban-American billionaire Mike Fernandez is disgusted by Trump and in an interview posted on Thursday by Politico, he expressed (shall we say) frustration at Republicans who  balls  to impeach Trump. All the Republicans who hide behind the flag and hide behind the church, they don t have the f  balls to do what it takes,  Fernandez told POLITICO Florida in a telephone interview on Thursday.Fernandez has long been a huge supporter of Republicans, especially at the state level in Florida. He supported Mitt Romney, Florida Governor Rick Scott, Jeb Bush and several others, but he s no longer a Republican because of Trump. In 2016, he spent $3.5 million in an effort to defeat Trump. I am out of the political process. Too disgusted, too expensive, too supportive of ego maniacs whose words have the value of quicksand,  he wrote in an email to a Republican fundraiser seeking political contributions. It is demoralizing to me to see adults worshipping a false idol. I can t continue to write checks for anyone,  he said.  I know what it s like to lose a country. It gets worse. Fernandez called Trump one of the worst words in the English language   for forced-birth Republicans. He called Trump an  abortion of a human being. If I was the doctor and knew what that baby would do, I d have made sure it never would have seen the light of day,  he said of the president.The most interesting thing about all of this is that this might be what it takes for Republicans to wake up. Face it, they aren t going to grow a set of balls (to paraphrase Fernandez) any time in the near future, but they will be terrified of losing their donor base.Billionaires, more than anyone, care about how our country is perceived on the world stage. Chaos means market uncertainty, which is never a good thing for the moneyed class. If Trump continues down his current path, he will soon start losing the confidence of the GOP donor base.

1,Fake,"July 20, 2017",News,"One of the many reasons Americans were suspicious of Donald Trump to begin with was because of his various business conflicts and shady finances, which have obviously become a major problem in his presidency.While Trump s Russia scandal is erupting, he s also being kept busy defending his several conflicts of interest, struggling to continue hiding his tax returns because they ll reveal not only a long history of debt, but a trail of shady business deals. Trump doesn t want America to know how much money he owes, or who he owes the money to.Notably, Deutsche Bank was one of the only lenders who wanted to work with Trump despite his horrible reputation for suing lenders and going back on his contracts. This bank, which has ties to Russia, loaned Trump hundreds of millions of dollars and thanks to Trump s Russia investigation, investigators are going to find out why.According to the New York Times, banking regulators are reviewing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans made to Mr. Trump s businesses through Deutsche Bank s private wealth management unit . . . to [see] if the loans might expose the bank to heightened risk. Trump s relationship with Deutsche Bank has been problematic for decades, and it s now going to bite him in the a**. Deutsche has given Trump over $4 billion over the last 20 years, and in return Trump sued the bank in 2008 when he fell behind on his payments on a $640 million load. To avoid paying the bank, Trump blamed it for the global crisis and said the bank should be paying HIM instead, leveraging the extraordinary event clause in his contract. Trump said: Deutsche Bank is one of the banks primarily responsible for the economic dysfunction we are currently facing. In response, Deutsche countersued for this  classic Trump  move. Trump was only able to pay the bank back because he got ANOTHER loan from Deutsche s wealth-management unit.This won t come as any shock to Americans, but Trump s shady family is also involved in this. Not only is Ivanka Trump a Deutsche Bank client, but so is her husband Jared Kushner, who is also up to his neck in the Russian scandal. Kushner got himself into the Russian mess by hiding his meeting with Sergey Gorkov, who happens to be the chief executive of Russian state-owned development bank Vnesheconombank, a bank that Deutsche Bank has a  cooperation agreement  with.Deutsche Bank is far from innocent, and that s exactly why it s being investigated right along with Trump. Check this out:. . . in May, federal prosecutors settled a case with a Cyprus investment vehicle owned by a Russian businessman with close family connections to the Kremlin. The firm, Prevezon Holdings, was represented by Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who was among the people who met during the presidential campaign with Donald Trump Jr. about Hillary Clinton. Federal prosecutors in the United States claimed Prevezon, which admitted no wrongdoing, laundered the proceeds of an alleged Russian tax fraud through real estate. Prevezon and its partner relied in part on $90 million in financing from a big European financial institution, court records show. It was Deutsche Bank.Trump does NOT want anyone investigating his financial ties, and he made this clear in his interview with the Times on Wednesday night. Trump clearly stated that he did not want anyone to examine his family s finances beyond any relationship to Russia. I think that s a violation.  Thanks to his shady dealing with Deutsche Bank, Trump s nightmare is coming true.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images", Trump In A Panic As Deutsche Bank Plans To Turn Over Financial Information To Investigators

The Committee has pre-approved subpoenas in order to force Manafort and Don Jr. to appear before the panel if they do not accept by Friday evening an invitation to appear next week, the Washington Post reports.Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), the Committee Chairman, said that Manafort, Trump Jr. and a third invited witness, Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson, have been given until Friday night to accept the invitation to testify in a public hearing which is scheduled for Wednesday.Now, if they do not accept this offer, the Iowa Republican said that subpoenas would be issued  almost immediately. We ve already authorized  the orders, Grassley said. He further noted that the committee s top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), had also signed off on the orders in advance.  She and I don t have to take any action   it s already been taken. According to a member of Manafort s legal team, they are considering the request. But it s really a request in name only since the subpoenas are ready to go.Things are so bad for Manafort that he s confused about which meeting to respond to first.Grassley scheduled the two senior Trump campaign surrogates to appear before the panel the same week as the Senate Intelligence Committee plans to interview the president s senior adviser and son-in-law, Jared Kushner. That interview is scheduled for Monday, according to Kushner s lawyer   although on Thursday, the Senate Intelligence Committee s top Democrat, Mark R. Warner (Va.), indicated the committee was also planning on a second audience with Kushner.Jared Kushner, Trump s son-in-law, is being scrutinized as well, along with Manafort and Don Jr., over their interactions with Russians, most of which have been revealed recently. Kushner had to update the list of foreign contacts on his disclosure form   which he needed to submit to get security clearance   three times. He added more than 100 people to it. Apparently, Kushner has a very bad memory.Kushner, Manafort and Trump Jr. will also be asked about their meeting at Trump Tower in June of 2016 in which they met with a Kremlin-connected lawyer in order to obtain damaging information on Hillary Clinton to help his father win the election.The number of people present at the meeting keeps increasing, which totally doesn t seem suspicious at all. Don Jr. said it was a conversation about adoption, but according to the emails Trump s son released on Twitter, there was no mention of that. Instead, it mentioned getting dirt on Clinton.The 8th person in that secret Russian meeting with Trump Jr. has been identified as Irakly Kaveladeze. He s a bit of a shady character who was once the subject of a congressional inquiry into money laundering. Kaveladeze was accused of being involved in a massive effort, in a ten year period, to launder $1.4 billion of Russian and Eastern European money through U.S. banks.Like Trump has said about his Russian scandal, Kaveladeze called his money laundering scandal a  witch hunt.

1,Fake,"July 20, 2017",News,"Whenever the White House puts out a statement regarding Donald Trump, you can be sure of one thing: it s just a matter of time until Trump himself contradicts that statement. Over and over, Trump has thrown his spokespeople under the bus as he publicly says the opposite of what his surrogates have told the public. And he just did it again.According to the White House, Trump s second meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin was merely  a brief conversation at the end of a dinner, nothing more than a perfectly innocent exchange of  pleasantries and small talk.  True to form, Trump blew this cover to smithereens shortly after the statement was made and revealed that the private meeting, which officials say lasted  more than an hour,  was actually a discussion about policy.Here is what Trump had to say to the New York Times about his second meeting with Putin:She [Melania Trump] was sitting next to Putin and somebody else, and that s the way it is. So the meal was going, and toward dessert I went down just to say hello to Melania, and while I was there I said hello to Putin. Really, pleasantries more than anything else. It was not a long conversation, but it was, you know, could be 15 minutes. Just talked about   things. Actually, it was very interesting, we talked about adoption.We talked about Russian adoption. Yeah. I always found that interesting. Because, you know, he ended that years ago. And I actually talked about Russian adoption with him, which is interesting because it was a part of the conversation that Don [Jr., Mr. Trump s son] had in that meeting.And here s the problem with what he said. The whole topic of Russian adoption is far from just being casual small talk. Putin got mad when President Obama implemented the Magnitsky Act in 2012, which was meant to punish Russia for their blatant human rights violations. In retaliation, Putin banned the adoption of Russian children by U.S. citizens.So, by stating that he and Putin discussed Russian adoptions, Trump just inadvertently admitted that he discussed official policy in a private meeting with a foreign adversary. Whoops. This puts the U.S. government at a significant disadvantage because we have no record of what transpired conversationally between the president and Putin, former NATO commander James Stavridis explained.Yet again, Trump has chosen Russia and Putin over the American people.

So, as part of the probe into possible ties between the Donald Trump campaign and Russia in the 2016 presidential election, the Special Counsel is now is examining a broad range of transactions involving Trump s businesses as well as those of his associates, according to what a person familiar with the probe told Bloomberg.FBI investigators and others are looking at Russian purchases of apartments in Trump buildings, Trump s involvement in a controversial SoHo development in New York with Russian associates, the 2013 Miss Universe pageant in Moscow and Trump s sale of a Florida mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008, the person said.The Trump Crime Family and Associates look like they re in deep sh*t:The investigation also has absorbed a money-laundering probe begun by federal prosecutors in New York into Trump s former campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Trump s lawyer, John Dowd, said on Thursday that the inquiry into Trump s businesses is  unrelated  to last year s election. Those transactions are in my view well beyond the mandate of the Special counsel; are unrelated to the election of 2016 or any alleged collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia and most importantly, are well beyond any Statute of Limitation imposed by the United States Code,  he stated in an email.We disagree! There s a saying which goes like this:  Follow the money  and apparently, Mueller has heard that wise quote before. There s a way that Trump could clear this all up. It would require the sitting  president  to release his tax returns, you know, like all of his predecessors have done.By the way, if Trump s resort in Florida mysteriously catches fire and he says,  Don t look in the garage for propellant  then I m pretty sure they will look into the garage.

Trump also warned Special Counsel Robert Mueller against investigating his family s financial matters.These statements are shocking and extremely unpresidential, but unfortunately we ve come to expect this from Trump and his highly flawed administration. But one person, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates, isn t going to let this slide. Having experienced Trump s wrath firsthand when she was fired by him several months ago for getting in the way of the infamous Muslim travel ban, Yates has been an outspoken opponent of Trump and has been giving him hell ever since.In a brutal message posted on Twitter, Yates trashed Trump for attacking a  bedrock principle of our democracy  with his disrespectful comments about the Department of Justice. She wrote: POTUS attack on Russia recusal reveals yet again his violation of the essential independence of DOJ, a bedrock principle of our democracy. While Trump still seems to think he can fire everyone who poses a threat to him, Yates is the perfect example that just because Trump strips people of their power and positions, he can t get them to shut up and stop exposing him. Yates has become a highly respected figure after she was responsible for shutting down Trump s Muslim ban, and the American people play attention to what she says.

At the same time, it s projected that the increases in premiums for those still with coverage would double and the average premiums for individuals purchased through exchanges or insurers would go up by about 25 percent next year compared to Obamacare, reaching approximately 50 percent in 2020. The repeal bill would also bring an immediate end to uninsured people paying a penalty for their lack of coverage, as well as ending funding for Medicaid further down the line.The report also came to the conclusion that insurers would leave the individual market due to the lack of penalties for the uninsured, mostly in anticipation of more high-cost customers and fewer enrolees. If this were to happen, roughly 50 percent of the nation would reside in areas with no insurers in the individual market by 2020, a number that would increase to around 75 percent by 2026, the result of less pressure on penalties and more on premiums.All we can hope for now is that the Senate will vote against a repeal of Obamacare without a replacement ready to go.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images"," 32 Million Uninsured, Premiums To Double If Obamacare Repealed But Not Replaced"

In a discussion about Mars, in which a NASA scientist said there might have been life on Mars many, many years ago, Rohrabacher just had to ask: You have indicated that Mars   was totally different thousands of years ago. Is it possible that there was a civilization on Mars thousands of years ago? Source: SlateYeah, just a couple of things here. The NASA scientist was talking about microbial life, not anything resembling human life and we re talking billions of years, not thousands of years ago.

In the past couple of weeks, that story has centered on Donald Trump, Jr. and his meeting with a bunch of Russians in Trump Tower in an effort to get dirt on Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Now, however, we turn our attentions more closely to another person who was in that meeting: Former Trump Campaign Manager Paul Manafort.According to the New York Times, Manafort could have been compromised by the Russians due to an amazing amount of money he owed them   to the tune of $17 million. This information comes via financial documents from Cyprus, a place for rich people to hide lots of money to avoid paying American taxes. According to those records   which have been verified   Manafort came by this debt when he was working for pro-Putin entities in Ukraine. He was apparently using shell companies to conduct business over there. Said companies owe Russian oligarchs a bunch of money, and they also owed said money during the time when Manafort was running Trump s campaign. The New York Times explains:The records, which include details for numerous loans, were certified as accurate by an accounting firm as of December 2015, several months before Mr. Manafort joined the Trump campaign, and were filed with Cyprus government authorities in 2016. The notion of indebtedness on the part of Mr. Manafort also aligns with assertions made in a court complaint filed in Virginia in 2015 by the Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska, who claimed Mr. Manafort and his partners owed him $19 million related to a failed investment in a Ukrainian cable television business.In other words, Paul Manafort is in deep sh*t with a some really dangerous Russians, and he was in that same kind of trouble while he was running an American presidential campaign. This revelation is just another in a long and complex line of Trump associates who somehow have ties to very dangerous Russians   some of which reach all the way up to the Kremlin and even Vladimir Putin himself.Make no mistake, folks   we have Russian agents in the White House.

1,Fake,"July 19, 2017",News,"The co-chair of Trump s voter fraud commission, set up to prove that Hillary Clinton didn t win the popular vote because of the  millions  of illegal votes he says were cast for his opponent, just inserted both feet in his mouth, grew a new foot, then shoved that one in the other available orifice on Wednesday when he admitted that Trump may not be our legitimate president. You know, we may never know the answer to that,  Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach told MSNBC s Katy Tur when asked whether he thought Clinton won the popular vote by 3 to 5 million votes. We will probably never know the answer to that question,  he said. In reality, Clinton only won by 2.87 million votes   but Kobach is a moron. How do you say we may never know the answer to that question?  Tur asked. Then things got really stupid: What I m saying is, let s suppose that the commission determined that there were a certain number of votes cast by ineligible voters. You still won t know whether those people who were ineligible voted for Trump or for Clinton or for somebody else.And so, it s impossible to ever know exactly, if you took out all the ineligible votes, what the final tally would be in that election. You can obviously, based on the data, you can make some very educated guesses. So are the votes for Donald Trump that led him to win the election in doubt as well?  Tur pressed. Absolutely,  replied Kobach.Voter fraud   especially in-person   is extremely rare, though a couple of Trump supporters have been caught illegally voting multiple times after he told them people would illegally vote for Hillary Clinton.In other words, the system works and people who try to vote illegally do get caught. The integrity of the voting systems themselves, however, could be questioned as Russian agents provably hacked our electoral system in 39 states.Is Donald Trump the legitimate President? The answer is that  he s an idiot  until we know the full extent of Russian attacks on our election.Watch the interview below:", Co-Chair Of Trump’s Voter Fraud Commission Says Trump May Not Have Been Legitimately Elected (VIDEO)

1,Fake,"July 19, 2017",News,"A new report has just revealed that Fox News patriarch Rupert Murdoch was so horrified by the idea of Donald Trump becoming president that he instructed former CEO Roger Ailes to do all he could to swing the election in favor of  anyone but Trump     even Hillary. The revelation came during an interview with Ailes that took place before his death, which was recently published in Hollywood Reporter to mark the one-year anniversary of Ailes  firing from the network due to his long history sexual harassment.Michael Wolff reports the following in the Hollywood Reporter article, published on Wednesday:It was Ailes  tacit support of Trump that, in part, made his removal from Fox all the more urgent for the Murdochs. And it was not just the liberal sons who were agitated by Ailes  regard for Trump, but also the father, whose tabloid, the New York Post, helped create Trump, but who found him now, with great snobbery, not of  our  conservative class. ( When is Donald Trump going to stop embarrassing his friends, let alone the whole country?  Murdoch senior tweeted the day after Trump officially declared himself a candidate.) Murdoch instructed Ailes to tilt to anyone but Trump, Ailes confided to me before he was fired, even Hillary. (Ailes, for his part, characterized Murdoch s periodic efforts at interference as similar to Nixon s instructions to bomb this or that country   best ignored.)Wolff s report also reveals that after Trump s surprise win on election night, Murdoch had no choice but to fall in line and kiss Trump s a**.After the election, a confounded Murdoch had to call on his ex-wife Wendi s friends, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, to broker a rapprochement with the disreputable Donald. Now, to Trump s great satisfaction, a humbled Murdoch is a constant caller.Republicans have all done the same as Murdoch. Even those  Never Trumpers  who openly opposed him throughout his campaign have all silently accepted their fate since his win. And it seems that no matter what he does now, even cozying up to Putin as the Russia scandal continues to heat up, conservatives still can t seem to find the guts to kick his orange derriere out of the White House.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images", Rupert Murdoch Told Roger Ailes To Help Elect ‘Anyone But Trump’ – ‘Even Hillary’ (DETAILS)
1,Fake,"July 19, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s presidency is spiraling out of control and Dear Leader appears to be holed up in the White House, avoiding even the people who still support him.Immediately following his return from the G20 summit in Europe this month, even his daily schedule went completely blank as he retreated behind the walls of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Trump has at least added some daily events to his schedule in recent days, but he s not venturing outside.It was Vice President Mike Pence   not Trump   who left the White House Tuesday and spoke publicly and at length about the Republicans  health care bill in the wake of its Senate collapse, not Trump. Unlike Trump, Pence has been maintaining a very public profile in recent days.Source: Share BlueIn the last month, when Trump wasn t leaving the country, pretty much the only reason he left the White House was to go play golf or to watch golf, which he did on June 24, 25, and 30, as well as July 1, 2, 3, 4, 9, 14, 15, and 16. Outside of playing golf or promoting his own business properties, however, Trump is clearly in hiding.To be fair, Trump isn t completely MIA. He did a photo op in a firetruck (just like a big boy) on Monday and he s spent a lot of time on his golf course. But when it comes to using his legendary (in his own mind) negotiating skills to help save the repeal and replacement of Obamacare (one of his top campaign promises), the Deal Artist offered little to nothing.While this is pretty much unprecedented, it signals something major is happening within the White House. Since taking office, he s soothed his fragile ego by holding campaign style rallies in front of fawning fans. The last one he held, which was his last state-side public appearance, was nearly a month ago. While the fans still exist, Trump is even avoiding them. Instead, he s presumably seeking comfort in Kentucky Fried Chicken and chocolate cake in front of an increasingly incredulous Fox News.This isn t particularly surprising. Trump has a difficult time in situations that don t offer him adulation.

1,Fake,"July 19, 2017",News,"According to the results from a recent survey by Public Policy Polling, only 45 percent of Donald Trump voters polled wholeheartedly believe that Donald Trump Jr. met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, despite the fact that the U.S. President s eldest son has openly admitted doing so.President Trump s alleged collusion with Russia has been one of the main stories doing the rounds since before his inauguration, but more fuel was added to the fire when the New York Times broke the news at the beginning of the month of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with ties to Russian leader Vladimir Putin, and six others in an effort to obtain damaging information about his father s campaign rival, Hillary Clinton, back in June 2016.Donald Trump Jr. has since admitted that the meeting took place and has even given details of the attendees, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump s son-in-law and now-senior adviser, Jared Kushner, however, many Trump voters aren t so sure.Despite these admissions from the man himself, 32 percent of the Trump voters surveyed believe that the meetings didn t happen at all and a further 24 percent weren t entirely sure. To make matters even worse, 72 percent believed the whole story about Russia meddling in last years presidential election to be  fake news,  while only 14 percent disagreed entirely with that notion.Some other points of interest that came from the results of the Trump voters surveyed:But it isn t all bad news. The very same survey showed that only 41 percent of his surveyed voters approve of the job he s doing, whereas 55 percent don t. To make matters worse, just 37 percent of his voters consider Trump to be honest, but 57 percent say he isn t, and 52 percent call him an outright liar, while only 40 percent disagree with that label being used to describe the President.

Trump claimed that other world leaders had been invited and that the media had been well aware of the meeting.Trump apparently still doesn t understand that now that he s President of the United States, nothing in his life is private anymore. The president and his administration are expected to be transparent with the American people, and they ve truly incriminated themselves by failing to disclose this meeting. We can all assume that if this news hadn t come out, the Trump administration never would have disclosed it.Trump obviously doesn t think that having (and then hiding) a private meeting with the foreign leader who meddled in his country s election looks shady. It s hilarious that Trump referred to these reports as  fake news , only to have his own administration confirm that the meeting took place. Even Trump himself confirmed it in his tweets by talking about the other people that joined him and Putin!As Trump s meltdown over his Russia meeting continues, his focus and attention on negotiating a health care bill with Senate Republicans will be greatly compromised.

1,Fake,"July 19, 2017",News,"The story of Donald Trump Jr. s 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer capable of providing damning information against his father s then presidential campaign running mate, Hillary Clinton, appears to be an ever changing one. News broke last week that there was an eighth person involved, Irakly Kaveladze, whose presence was confirmed by a lawyer for Aras Agalarov.The meeting is a story that is a little hard to keep track of so let s do a role call of the other seven attendees first   The meeting was arranged by Donald Trump Jr. as the main representative for his father with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer with the dirt on Hillary. Also present was President Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-chair of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, both of whom were there at the request of Trump Jr, seemingly to make the meeting appear more serious. Then there was Rob Goldstone, a British publicist who contacted the Trumps on behalf of the Agalarovs, the Russian Oligarchs with ties to Vladimir Putin and a Trump family friend, who set up the session in the first place. Also present was Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who, by his own admission, worked as a military counterintelligence officer for the former Soviet Union and had also bragged about how easily he could coordinate an email hacking campaign, and Anatoli Samochornov, a former State Department staffer who was there solely to translate.Which brings us to Irakly Kaveladze, a 52-year-old born in the Soviet Republic of Georgia who immigrated to the US in 1991. Also known as  Ike,  Kaveladze was the eighth person present during the meeting and this is where things get truly interesting, as Kaveladze was once the main focal point of a congressional money-laundering probe. On his personal website, Kaveladze refers to himself as the vice president of Agalarov s Moscow-based real estate company, Crocus Group. His LinkedIn profile has him living in the Russian Federation, however, public records show he is linked to New Jersey-based businesses.Kaveladze is listed in business filings as founder of the IBC Group, based at 333 Sylvan Ave. in Englewood Cliffs, in a completely empty suite with unopened mail by the door. That exact New Jersey address is also shared with several shell companies connected to Aras Agalarov, one of which is Saffron Property Management, which Agalarov reportedly used to purchase an $11 million condominium last year in Florida. The other companies that share the Sylvan Ave. address include CI Publishing, PB Consulting, Russian Art Mall and a company called RJI Properties, run by two childhood friends of Agalarov s son, Emin. For some strange reason, RJI s Instagram account links to Emin s sister s real estate profile.Another thing his own webpage and LinkedIn profile both fail to mention is Kaveladze s alleged role in laundering $1.4 billion during the mid-1990s. In November, 2000, Kaveladze was named in news stories after a report on Russian money laundering through U.S. financial institutions was issued by the General Accounting Office. According to the congressional inquiry, Kaveladze formed 2,000 corporations for Russian brokers through his company which was called International Business Creations at the time. These corporations were then used to help steer more than $1.4 billion in wire transactions through U.S. banks.The story of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Russian lawyers may have been compelling when the story first broke, but this is only the beginning.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images", The Eighth Person In Trump Tower Meeting Is Linked To Money Laundering
1,Fake,"July 19, 2017",News,"How the hell can anybody call themselves intelligent when they re supporting Donald Trump? It s a question that baffles people who are able to think critically, able to read and comprehend both history and current events, and able to see through Trump s thin fa ade of know-it-all-ism and deep into what he is   an ignorant, narcissistic, and dangerous conman.Trump supporters not only don t see this, they re happy that there s someone running for president that thinks exactly like them. Take Melanie Austin, of Brownsville, Pennsylvania. She thought her beliefs about Obama being a gay Muslim from Kenya and Michelle being transgender were just fringe beliefs   right up until she started hearing similar stuff from Trump and other right-wing extremists.Now she knows she s right about all of this. You can t tell her that she s ignorant and dumb if she can t figure this out for herself. You can t tell her she s delusional. You can sit there with her, and countless others like her, and present facts, figures, charts, studies, and more, all from the most reputable sources there are, and prove that her lord and savior is wrong, and you ll still get shot down.There s more to this than the problem of confirmation bias. Austin gets much of her information from fringe right-wing blogs and conspiracy sites, but that s not all of it. Many of Trump s supporters are seriously too dumb to know they re dumb. It s called the Dunning-Kruger effect, and it s an unshakeable illusion that you re much smarter, and more skilled and/or knowledgeable, than you really are.People like Austin labor under the illusion that their knowledge about things is at least as good as, if not better than, the actual facts. For these people, though, their knowledge isn t just superior   it s superior even to those who have intimate and detailed knowledge of the subject at hand. Trump himself has exemplified this countless times, such as when he claimed he knows more about ISIS than even our military generals do.His fans simply take his word for it, and believe that because he knows, they know. They are literally incapable of seeing that they don t know.To be sure, the Dunning-Kruger effect is present everyone all across the political spectrum, and indeed, in every walk of life. We all overestimate our abilities and knowledge somewhere. However, the effect is especially pronounced in people with limited intellectual and social skills: [P]eople who are unskilled in [intellectual and social domains] suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them of the metacognitive ability to realize it. So basically, yes, it s possible to be too dumb to realize you re dumb.In four separate studies, people who scored in the bottom quarter on tests involving everything from humor to logic, and even to grammar, grossly overestimated where they thought they would score. They averaged scores in the 12th percentile, while their average estimate of their own scores was the 62nd percentile.The researchers attribute that huge discrepancy to a literal inability to distinguish accuracy from error. Or, to put it another way, those who are the most lacking in skills and knowledge are the least able to see it.Take the case of McArthur Wheeler, a man who robbed two banks in 1995 and was caught rather easily. He thought he would get away with it because he rubbed his face with lemon juice, which is used in invisible ink. To test the theory that lemon juice would turn him invisible, he rubbed it on his face, took a Polaroid, and his face wasn t in the picture! So he thought he was safe from security cameras because he could make his face invisible.He was shocked when police caught him because of that, saying,  But I wore the juice.  He literally couldn t see the ridiculousness of that line of thought. David Dunning, one of the first to catalog the Dunning-Kruger effect (hence its name), has studied human behavior including voter behavior for decades. He penned an op-ed in Politico that explains why this effect is so pronounced in Trump s supporters: It suggests that some voters, especially those facing significant distress in their life, might like some of what they hear from Trump, but they do not know enough to hold him accountable for the serious gaffes he makes. They fail to recognize those gaffes as missteps.  Again, the key to the Dunning-Kruger Effect is not that unknowledgeable voters are uninformed; it is that they are often misinformed their heads filled with false data, facts and theories that can lead to misguided conclusions held with tenacious confidence and extreme partisanship, perhaps some that make them nod in agreement with Trump at his rallies. Trump is completely inept, and his supporters are way too poorly-informed to know that he s inept, and too dumb themselves to know how dumb they are. That s why Trump s supporters are so sure they re smart and their president is smart that they won t listen to reason. The effect is strong in these people.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images", Are Trump Supporters Too Dumb To Know They’re Dumb? Science Says “Probably”

Now it looks like he is going to achieve his goal, just at the expense of programs to promote human rights and fight world poverty.Tillerson is apparently closing the Office of Global Criminal Justice, reassigning Todd Buchwald, the office s special coordinator since December, 2015, and a career State Department lawyer, to a position in the State Department s office of legal affairs. Buchwald was also informed that the other staff members may possibly be shifted to the State Department s Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor.The State Department has neither confirmed nor denied the move. The State Department is currently undergoing an employee-led redesign initiative, and there are no predetermined outcomes,  a spokesperson said, later emphasizing, We are not going to get ahead of any outcomes. One person who clearly doesn t approve of the possible shuttering of the office is David Scheffer, a professor at Northwestern University s Pritzker School of Law, who also served as the first U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues. This is a very harsh signal to the rest of the world that the United States is essentially downgrading the importance of accountability for the commission of atrocity crimes,  Scheffer said. This sends a strong signal to perpetrators of mass atrocities that the United States is not watching you anymore. The Office Of Global Criminal Justice was first established by former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in 1997 to raise the importance of confronting mass murder in U.S. foreign policy, largely in response to the genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda, creating the post of Ambassador-at-Large for War Crimes Issues along the way. Over the following two decades, the office joined forces with several international criminal courts in an attempt to bring justice, not only to Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia, but also to Cambodia and the Central African Republic. Furthermore, the office lobbied for greater U.S. support for the International Criminal Court (ICC).The office also tried to raise the level of awareness of the importance of supporting the prosecution of mass murderers all around the globe, from Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, even helping to run a special rewards fund for information leading to the apprehension of war criminals.But sadly, it seems like that s all in the past now.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images"," Trump’s White House Decides War Crimes Don’t Matter, Shuts Accountability Office Down"

He actually had the gall to accuse Democrats of not caring about people even though the  repeal and replace  bill his party tried to pass would have stripped healthcare away from millions of Americans and would have gutted Medicaid all while erasing the protections provided by the Affordable Care Act. He even made the outrageous claim that Republicans reached out to Democrats to work with them on the bill. I imagine many Democrats were celebrating last night,  McConnell said during a speech on the Senate floor.  I hope they consider what they re celebrating. The American people are hurting, they need relief, and it s regretful that our Democratic colleagues decided early on that they did not want to engage with us seriously in the process to deliver that relief. These are not just numbers on a page these are real people,  he continued.Except that Republicans never asked Democrats to work with them. Republicans wrote the destructive bill all by themselves and they demanded that Democrats vote blindly in favor of it.As we all know, Democrats told Republicans to go f*ck themselves. And even some Republicans refused to support the bill because it was that bad. Many Republicans faced massive opposition from their own constituents at town halls over the bill.And if Republicans really cared about  real people,  they would have drafted a bill that doesn t kick over 20 million real people off of their health insurance. It s that simple.But McConnell wants to blame Democrats and pretend that his party cares about people. That doesn t jive considering that Republicans tried killing Obamacare mostly because they wanted to give a fat tax gift to the wealthy at the expense of  real people  who would not be able to afford healthcare without Obamacare. I regret that the effort to immediately repeal and replace Obamacare will not be successful,  McConnell said.  That doesn t mean we should give up. We will now try a different way to bring the American people relief from Obamacare. That plan is not exactly  different  either.

1,Fake,"July 17, 2017",News,"Well, it seems that despite the efforts of notoriously crafty Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the GOP s massive tax cut for the rich healthcare bill is dead for now. Senator John McCain (R-AZ)  is out for emergency surgery   we wish him well, of course    and Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) and Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) were already hard  NO!  votes. Then, late Monday night, Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) came out against the bill as well. Each Senator had his or her own reasons for opposing McConnell, but those reasons matter not for now. The votes to pass this disastrous piece of legislation simply are not there.Of course, upon hearing that he was, once again about to be humiliated on one of his signature campaign promises, Donald Trump took to Twitter to fume about the bill s failure in the Senate. He tweeted that he wants to simply repeal the Affordable Care Act now and rip healthcare away from millions. He also said the unthinkable in this hyper-partisan environment: Work with Democrats. Here is his tweet:Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 18, 2017Now, we all know that McConnell knows that Trump is a fool, and he will likely not heed anything Trump has to say. But this just goes to show two things: 1) Republicans cannot govern their way out of a paper bag, even when they control the entire government, and 2) Trump, once again, shows poor impulse control on Twitter, as well as a woefully inept understanding of the workings on the legislative branch of the government he now supposedly runs.Either way, these tweets are whiny, pathetic, and like something you d see from a child.

1,Fake,"July 17, 2017",News,"For months now, the Republicans have been doing all they can to ram through a disastrous   even deadly   massive tax cut for rich people healthcare bill. Finally, the Senate had come up with a version that looked like it might pass   but then moderate Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Libertarian Rand Paul (R-KY) said they would vote for it under no circumstances. They had different reasons, of course   Senator Collins knew it would be a potential death knell for the most vulnerable among us, while Senator Paul thought the bill wasn t conservative enough and didn t actually repeal the Affordable Care Act.After Collins and Paul came out against the bill, which the GOP is hilariously calling the Better Care Reconciliation Act, that only left one vote that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell could lose and still pass his bill and get it to Donald Trump s desk, with Mike Pence acting as the tie-breaking vote.Everything changed when Senator John McCain (R-AZ) had to have emergency surgery to remove a blood clot over his left eye. He is now at home in Arizona, and we wish him a speedy recovery. This, however, was a game changer. It meant that without McCain s vote, McConnell was one vote short. So, of course he shelved the vote until McCain s return.Well, as of Monday night, none of that matters, as Senators Mike Lee (R-UT) and Jerry Moran (R-KS) came out against the bill because they, like Rand Paul, don t think it is cruel enough to the poor, the elderly, children, and the disabled. However, despicable as their reasons may be, for the moment that matters not. McConnell does not have the votes he needs to pass this bill. For now that is a win for us.Now, all of that being said, a word of caution   these people have been vowing to get rid of the Affordable Care Act for the last seven years.

If this continues this immobilization of the presidency over these kind of things it s gonna force Congress to do an investigation, a complete and thorough investigation, and that means go back all the way to the 650,000 emails of Anthony Weiner and look at [former FBI Director James] Comey and his activities,  King told CNN s Alisyn Camerota.When pressed by Camerota to elaborate farther, King went as far as to paint Comey and the special counsel burdened with the task of investigating Trump s possible Russia ties as the ones that are truly guilty of collusion. What I m saying is this, that the Comey investigation now him picking the special counsel on top of it on its face, appears to be collusion,  King added, however, there s just one small problem with that statement  Special Counsel Robert Mueller wasn t appointed by James Comey, rather by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein.This has been a common pattern by the Republican party when dealing with any controversy or scandal involving the President during his six-month tenure in power; just try and distract the media as well as the public from the real issues at hand by trying to create new ones involving Hillary Clinton s campaign.This very technique was what they turned to in May during a Senate hearing that featured testimony from former acting Attorney General Sally Yates and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper; rather than focussing on the task at hand, Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruise just spent his time asking Clapper about Clinton s emails. Another Texan Republican Senator, John Coryn, did the exact same thing last month during James Comey s Senate testimony. Even Republican Senator Lindsay Graham from South Carolina recently told Fox News that now that Robert Mueller is investigating President Trump, Congress should ditch their own investigations and resume looking into Clinton s emails.It is a simple fall back plan the GOP keep using and it has been reasonably effective.

Now a source is saying he didn t read the part about the Russians, despite the fact that the subject line read:  Re: Russia   Clinton   private and confidential.

But a source close to the situation told BuzzFeed that Mr Kushner did not read to the bottom of the email, missing out key words like  Russian government  and therefore did not realise what the meeting was about.Source: IndependentOh, and the defense gets worse. According to the source, Kushner only attended the meeting to talk about Russian adoptions. There was no mention of Russian adoptions at all in the email chain.Not coincidentally, Donald Trump s campaign manager at the time, Paul Manafort, also claimed that he was innocent because he didn t read the whole thing.What makes it even more difficult to believe Kushner is that he s already proven himself a consummate liar.

Some weren t fond of either (13%), but the evidence was clear   the people in this country do not want the GOP to repeal the Affordable Care Act and replace it with one of their death sentences.This poll comes just days after Trump trashed the Republican Party on Twitter, calling out their  failed  health care plan and urging them to make a decision as soon as possible. Trump and the GOP are more desperate than ever for a legislative win, and this poll proves that it s only going to be another humiliating loss for them. Every time the Congressional Budget Office analyzes one of the Republicans  proposals, each version looks worse than the last.Americans are already well aware that many of them (millions, actually) will lose their health care coverage under Trumpcare. For many, the GOP s replacement plan will be life-threatening. Even a good portion of Trump s most loyal supporters are terrified of losing their Obamacare, and have publicly spoken out in favor of keeping the health care bill because they ve benefited so greatly from it.One thing is for sure   when Trump sees what his favorite news channel has just tweeted, he s going to have a colossal meltdown.

It s a book about leadership and his search for truth, informed by lessons and experiences he s had throughout his career, including his recent experiences in the Trump administration,  Matt Latimer, whose agency also represents Comey, says.  It will speak to a broader desire in our country for more ethical leadership.It really does sound interesting, and it s no surprise that publishers are willing to hand Comey ridiculous amounts of money for it:The book will not be a conventional tell-all memoir, but an exploration of the principles that have guided Mr. Comey through some of the most challenging moments of his legal career. Among those are his investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server during a contentious election, and his recent entanglement with the president over the F.B.I. s inquiry into Russia s interference in the 2016 election.Comey initially was reluctant to write a tell-all, but ultimately decided that he had more to say than just a retelling of his career. The Times notes that he plans to use the book to  write candidly about his experience serving in multiple administrations, and to use moments from his career to draw lessons about ethics, decision making and leadership. As with his personal memos he shared with the media through a friend, Comey s book will be vetted to ensure that no classified information is contained.While the book is simply going to be a study of Comey s principles through the years, it is sure to enrage Trump, who considers facts and truth to be an anathema.Featured image via screengrab", James Comey Is Doing Something That Will Have Trump Sh*tting His Pants

However, there is one Fox journalist who has gone rogue: Shepard Smith.Now, Smith has been known to buck against the more ridiculous or downright lying elements of his network before. That has included being openly critical of the Trump Administration when most folks there are walking the party line. He s really taken things much further in that direction now, though, since the recent revelations regarding Trump s mini me s attempts to get dirt on Hillary Clinton from the Russians during the 2016 election season. Speaking with fellow more-reasonable-than-most Fox host Chris Wallace on Friday, Shep Smith went nuclear. Here is the transcript of that exchange from the Washington Post, which has called the diatribe Smith s  Cronkite moment : We re still not clean on this, Chris [Wallace]. If there s nothing there   and that s what they tell us, they tell us there s nothing to this and nothing came of it, there s a nothingburger, it wasn t even memorable, didn t write it down, didn t tell you about it, because it wasn t anything so I didn t even remember it   with a Russian interpreter in the room at Trump Tower? If all of that, why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean, you know? My grandmother used to say when first we practice to   Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive. The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling. And there are still people who are out there who believe we re making it up. And one day they re gonna realize we re not and look around and go, Where are we, and why are we getting told all these lies? This is amazing, considering the culture over at Fox. Don t fall in lockstep? You re probably risking your job. Further, since Fox and their constant lies, spin, bigotry, misogyny, and all manner of distastefulness is so toxic to the other, more credible networks, a person might have a difficult time finding journalistic employment elsewhere. Given all of that, this was an amazingly courageous thing to do.Thank you for bringing real news to America s most deceitful network, Mr. Smith. Hats off to you, and keep it up. Perhaps CNN or   dare I say it   MSNBC will give you a shot should Fox heed the calls from deluded Trumpkins to fire you. MSNBC is my favorite network, and I d definitely tune in.Watch this amazing moment below:Shep Smith:  The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling why are we getting told all these lies?

1,Fake,"July 15, 2017",News,"Star Trek legend George Takei gloriously shredded Donald Trump s dipshit son in a column which includes a poem for Trump Jr. to read to pass the time in his prison cell.As we all know by now, Trump Jr. released an email chain of himself agreeing to a meeting with a Russian lawyer who offered to give the Trump campaign dirt on Hillary Clinton to use in the 2016 Election. The information was received from the Russian government through Aras Agalarov, a Russian oligarch who is close to Vladimir Putin and one of Donald Trump s friends.It has since been revealed that a former Soviet intelligence officer also attended the meeting, which took place inside Trump Tower.In a scathing column published on Saturday, Takei recounts the news of the scandal and proceeds to inform Trump Jr. that he is going to jail. The latest  I can t believe this actually happened  bombshell concerns, of course, not Trump himself but his namesake, Donald, Jr., whose emails confirming Russian support for his father and meddling in the election present such low hanging evidentiary fruit that even Jeffrey Beauregard Sessions III could pick them,  Takei wrote.The emails, released by Junior in advance of a damning story by the Times, no doubt in a vain attempt to blunt the story s impact or at least divert its media coverage, has had something of the opposite effect. Importantly, Junior also had copied then-campaign manager Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner on his response, indicating that the campaign s senior staff were willing to accept damaging information on the Democratic opponent from a foreign hostile state. Their subsequent attendance of the meeting confirmed this. In attendance at the meeting itself was not only a lawyer from the Russian government but also a known Russian counterintelligence officer. The story grows, and darkens. This email string thus comprises the first direct evidence of coordination between the campaign and the Russians, but unlikely the last.In light of these damning revelations, Takei wrote a poem to commemorate Trump Jr s crimes against the United States.Lest there be any confusionDon Jr. has dispelled the illusionHis emails revealedWhat they thought was concealedNow he s gonna do time for collusionTakei went on to point out that on the very same day of the meeting, Trump wrote a speech about how Russia has a  blackmail file  on Clinton, and delivered it later that same month along with a plea to Russian hackers to continue attacking her and the DNC in search of emails.Takei couldn t resist taking note of the irony of it all.The president, in tepid defense of his son, remarked that Junior is a  good boy,  a  high-quality person,  and that he applauds his  transparency.  I can t but help think the president probably wishes that level of transparency would render Junior invisible right about now. For with now another member of his immediate family caught up in the Russia investigation, and the curious timing of his speeches, it becomes increasingly implausible that all this was happening without the president s knowledge.And what poetic irony it would be if Trump s downfall resulted from emails.Indeed, it would not only be  poetic irony,  but poetic justice as well.Featured Image: Frederick M.

1,Fake,"July 14, 2017",News,"It s only been a few days since Donald Trump as been back from his second international tour, but America is already sick of him. Over the past week or so, Trump and his corrupt inner circle have been in the news nonstop for their unethical behavior revolving around Russia.If America is sick of reading about it, reporters must be sick of talking about it   and this was evident when Chuck Todd went off on Trump on Friday during MTP Daily. Todd did not hold back as unleashed an attack for several minutes, brutally mocking the Trump administration for the never-ending avalanche of bad news surrounding Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with a Russian lawyer. Blasting the White House for trying to hide parts of the story, Todd said: Their responses this week have proven to be incomplete at best and untrue at worst. Todd was referring to a breaking report by NBC news, in which an additional unknown person   former Soviet counterintelligence officer Ranit Akhmetshin, was found to also have been in attendance during the now infamous meeting with the Russian lawyer. To make his point even more powerful, Todd ran several clips from the past few days that blatantly showed White House officials lying and denying that they were hiding any information. It was a brilliant segment, and Todd perfectly showed America why Trump and his minions cannot be trusted. In conclusion, Todd said: Folks, this week has been a giant PR, political, and possibly legal disaster for this administration.

1,Fake,"July 14, 2017",News,"While the defense of three members of Trump s camp meeting with Russians last year has taken more turns than a roller coaster, one defense has been constant: It s a  nothing burger.  While Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and Paul Manafort did meet with Russians to get dirt on Hillary Clinton, the argument is that it doesn t matter because they didn t actually receive any dirt.Of course that argument gave us a whole host of botched bank robber and  To Catch a Predator  analogies, basically saying that if you intend to commit a crime and you act upon it, you have committed a crime, whether or not you get the goods.No matter how flawed that defense is, though, it turns out it s not even true. Trump Jr., Kushner and Manafort were given some dirt on Hillary Clinton. From near the bottom of an AP article:Veselnitskaya brought with her a plastic folder with printed-out documents that detailed what she believed was the flow of illicit funds to the Democrats, Akhmetshin said. Veselnitskaya presented the contents of the documents to the Trump associates and suggested that making the information public could help the campaign, he said. This could be a good issue to expose how the DNC is accepting bad money,  Akhmetshin recalled her saying.Trump Jr. asked the attorney if she had sufficient evidence to back up her claims, including whether she could demonstrate the flow of the money. But Veselnitskaya said the Trump campaign would need to research it more. After that, Trump Jr. lost interest, according to Akhmetshin. They couldn t wait for the meeting to end,  he said.Akhmetshin said he does not know if Veselnitskaya s documents were provided by the Russian government. He said he thinks she left the materials with the Trump associates. It was unclear if she handed the documents to anyone in the room or simply left them behind, he said.So if the members of the Trump campaign didn t take the information, it was only because they would have had to do some of their own legwork. Not only is this administration the most crooked in American history, they are the most lazy. They didn t just want some opposition research from the Russians. They appeared to want the Russians to do all their work for them.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.", Bombshell Report Shows The Russian Meeting Was No ‘Nothing Burger’

After this lengthy and deeply offensive speech, King wound the whole thing up by ranting about how the only reason people will become Navy SEALS now is to get free gender reassignment surgery. He said: And we are thinking that we are going to make the military better while people lining up at the recruitment center who have planned to do sexual assignment surgery and know if I can get into the Navy, army, air force and Marines and become a Navy SEAL and submit to sexual reassignment surgery and go from a man to a woman. By the way, it doesn t look like there will be any women becoming men after going through SEAL training. So let me get this straight. Someone would go through the hell that is SEAL training just to get gender reassignment for free? Why would they do that?

1,Fake,"July 14, 2017",News,"We all know that the GOP is the party of anti-LGBTQ theocrats. However, we usually don t expect lawmakers of either party to openly harass citizens and then go on to boast of what they have done without shame. That is, however, exactly what State Rep. Francis Awerkamp (R-KS) did when a group of LGBTQ students, escorted by educators, visited the state capitol.Awerkamp promptly posted what he had done to Facebook, burying his repugnant actions in a post disguised as a  legislative update. This was quickly done after he encountered the group at the capitol, in which he detailed a shocking display of open and unabashed bigotry and harassment. In the newsletter, the bigoted lawmaker said: I explained my clear position that  a man is a man, a woman is a woman, and marriage is between a man and a woman, and this is a reality that we can not change.  The teachers, one of whom was a man wearing a skirt  identifying  as a woman, quickly led the students away. By the way the  man in a skirt  he mentioned was not transgender at all. She is a cisgender woman. Due to the horrific nature of what has happened, Tom Witt, Director of Equality Kansas, has gotten involved. He said that there was only one transgender teacher on the outing, and she was not dressed in a skirt. Either way, it should not matter. Witt went on to rightly blast Awerkamp s confrontational remarks as beyond offensive and demeaning. The crazy man who likes to call himself a lawmaker also said he was  surprised  by the visit, and lamented the false idea that public funds are somehow being used to push a  homosexual agenda. Newsflash, dude   people visit their state capitols all the time. It s the people s house. Not yours. You work for your constituents, not the other way around.The fact that this man is sitting in government is nothing short of appalling. The Kansas State Legislature should censure him immediately.

1,Fake,"July 14, 2017",News,"It turns out that Donald Trump was abusing his power when he accused Qatar of supporting terrorism and allowed sanctions against them.Jared Kushner did not gain his position by getting confirmed by the Senate. He got his cushy White House job because he is married to Trump s daughter Ivanka.And he has been using his position in an effort to do business, and is using Trump s power as president to retaliate against those who refuse to do business with him.Just before Trump went on a tirade against Qatar, Kushner tried to get a loan from one of the richest men in the small country, Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani.Kushner asked for a $500 million loan from al-Thani because he needs to come up with $1.3 billion in the next two years before the interest-only mortgage is due on his family s 666 Fifth Avenue building in Manhattan. The only stipulation to getting the loan was that Kushner had to come up with some co-funding for the project. Of course, Kushner failed to live up to his end of the deal, so al-Thani wisely walked away rather than risk that much money on someone who makes promises he can t keep.And because al-Thani rejected Kushner s request, Donald Trump retaliated against Qatar by accusing the Gulf nation of being too close to Iran and gave Saudi Arabia the green light to cut diplomatic ties with Qatar and block transports there. Saudi Arabia is home to some Trump businesses, and Trump has been sucking up to the Saudi government, so of course, Saudi Arabia would gladly help Trump punish Qatar for refusing to give his family money.During my recent trip to the Middle East I stated that there can no longer be funding of Radical Ideology.

But Trump refuses to stop punishing Qatar just because they refused to give money to Jared Kushner.This is what abuse of power looks like. Trump and Kushner are using the White House to punish nations who refuse to do business with them. That is grounds for impeachment right there. This is exactly why Trump should have been forced to cut all ties with his businesses, and why anyone who works in the White House should do the same to avoid these kinds of conflicts of interest.Clearly, Trump and his family are using the presidency as a way to enrich themselves.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images"," Trump Abuses Power, Punishes Qatar For Refusing To Give $500 Million Loan To Son-In-Law Kushner"

1,Fake,"July 14, 2017",News,"Keeping in line with his constant backtracking and just generally erratic ways, President Donald Trump has taken a softer stance on what was seen as essentially his core campaign promise by claiming that the 2,000 mile long wall he initially intended to build along the border with Mexico may not need to cover the full distance due to natural borders that already exist. You have mountains. You have some rivers that are violent and vicious. You have some areas that are so far away that you don t really have people crossing,  the President told reporters aboard Air Force One on his recent flight to Paris.  But you ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles. Trump made the construction of a big beautiful wall, with a big beautiful door,  a solid structure 30 feet high in an effort to curb illegal immigration the cornerstone of his 2016 election campaign, insisting that Mexico would pay for it with the cost estimated to be in the vicinity of $20 billion, although he later stated that could be cut by covering the wall in solar panels. Naturally Mexico has refused to pay, most likely because they never requested the border wall in the first place, however, Trump still believes he will find a way to get them to cough up the cash after construction begins.But if you believe that the President s insistence that Mexico will reimburse the US for construction for the wall is the only flaw in his plan, you are sadly mistaken. First of all, almost all of that  700 to 900 miles  that Trump mentioned, less than half of the length of the US-Mexico border, already has walls and fences. In fact, the current border wall is already 650 miles long. Also, as for the rivers that are  violent and vicious,  yes a large part of the border in Texas consists of the Rio Grande, but some parts of that river are barely more than a trickle of water.President Trump also now believes the border wall needs to be transparent. You have to be able to see through it,  he said.  As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don t see them. They hit you on the head with 60 pounds of stuff? It s over. We re now six months into his presidency and Trump has only requested $1.6 billion from Congress for the project, or roughly 8 percent of the total estimate. Maybe he has just learned that according to Pew Research Center, approximately 66 percent of the illegal immigrants in the US have been here for at least a decade, that the amount of illegal Mexican immigrants has been in decline for the last 10 years and is now one million less than it was in 2007, or that Mexicans only make up 52 percent of illegal immigrants in the United States.Featured image via Sandy Huffaker/Getty Images", Trump Now Says Wall May Not Need A Wall To Cover Entire US-Mexico Border

During an investigation into his December 2013 arrest and subsequent beating of Patassa Johnson, URL s with names like  n**gadown.com  and  n***gaguns.com  were discovered owned by Granias. There were also violent URL s like  murdertech.com.  The websites were discovered with a simple internet search of Granias by Johnson s lawyer, Brenden Shiller.According to the Daily Beast, Johnson is expected to get $185,000 from the City of Chicago. The driving under the influence charge was dropped. The lawsuit says that Johnson suffered an unbelievably harrowing experience at the hands of this racist cop:The officer cuffed her in the back of a squad car and drove her to a police station, where  Granias grabbed [Johnson] from the back of the car,  and roughly escorted her into the station, according to a lawsuit Johnson filed against the city in 2015.  Inside the station, Defendant Granias beat [Johnson] while [Johnson] was in hand-cuffs. Brenden Shiller says of discovering the racist websites that were registered to Grainias   some as recently as 2013: We came across that URL and said what the hell is this? He made it live and accessible to the public. You can create a website, but Google wouldn t know about it unless you make it live and accessible. In addition to the racist websites, Granias has three other disciplinary remarks on his police record, all of them related to abuses of power. Nevertheless, he remains in this position of great power at the Chicago Police Department as we speak.

1,Fake,"July 13, 2017",News,"With the release of the email chain that proves that Donald Trump Jr., Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner met with the Russians with the idea of getting dirt on Hillary Clinton; after Jared Kushner (Donald Trump s son-in-law) failed to disclose multiple meetings with Russians (which is a crime), he has managed to keep his security clearance. Democrats tried to do something about it, but Republicans, who are apparently with Trump till the very end, stopped them.House Democrats proposed an amendment that would strip Kushner of his security clearance. Republicans certainly have to be seeing the writing on the wall at this point   Trump and his crew (especially Kushner) are going down   but instead of using this opportunity to tell their constituents that they truly stand for law and order, Republicans are digging their heels and are prepared to go down with the ship (excuse the mixed metaphor). They blocked the amendment.Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), who chaired the Democratic National Committee during much of last year s campaign cycle, proposed an amendment targeting Kushner during a House Appropriations Committee markup session Thursday. It was voted down, 22-30, along party lines.The measure would have barred the government from issuing or maintaining a security clearance for any White House individual  under a criminal investigation by a Federal law enforcement agency for aiding a foreign government. This amendment is an important step in protecting the American people from the threat of hostile foreign interference. That is not a controversial or a political goal,  Wasserman Schultz said during the hearing. Revoking Jared Kushner s security clearance would send a clear signal to anyone who would consider aiding and abetting a foreign enemy state to affect the outcome of a U.S. presidential election that they will not be entrusted with our nation s most sensitive information,  she added.Source: Huffington PostThis proves that Republicans have lost all claims to patriotism. They have put party and even Russia before country. That s okay, though.

1,Fake,"July 13, 2017",News,"If you ve been living under a rock for the past few days, you re probably unaware that Donald Trump Jr. committed treason. After lying about it and realizing that wouldn t work, he tweeted out evidence of his guilt   something that for some reason doesn t have the Right up in arms like it would if anyone else did it.Trump Jr. received an email from a friend of his father s who helped the Trump family with the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow in 2013. Trump Jr. was told that a Kremlin-connected lawyer was offering him damaging information about Hillary Clinton on behalf of the Russian government.According to Donald Trump, this is perfectly normal. You or I, he says, would have made the decision to knowingly collude with a hostile foreign government for personal gain. I think from a practical standpoint, most people would have taken that meeting. It s called opposition research or even research into your opponent,  Trump told reporters at a press conference in Paris Thursday.The New York Times reports that this is not standard, and that the only parallel in U.S. history involves Richard Nixon:There is only one known historical parallel to the Trump campaign s contacts with the Russians, and it involves Richard M. Nixon. Running for president in 1968, Nixon told H. R. Haldeman, his eventual White House chief of staff, to  monkey wrench  peace talks in Vietnam in order to scuttle any deal that would have handed Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic nominee, a political victory in the closing days of the election.Nixon, a former senator and vice president, had a relationship with the South Vietnamese government. Earlier in the year, he had met with the country s ambassador and brought along Anna Chennault, a prominent Chinese-American Republican. As the author John A. Farrell writes in his new book,  Richard Nixon: The Life,  which reports the  monkey wrench  instructions, the call between Nixon and Haldeman took place on Oct. 22, 1968, and Haldeman dutifully jotted down what he was told.A group of aides to Ronald Reagan did meet in the fall of 1980 with an individual claiming to be an emissary from the Iranian government, but that person s legitimacy was never determined.The Trump family says that the meeting was not important because no usable information came from it (though Trump himself tweeted about Hillary Clinton s emails for the first time about 20 minutes after the meeting ended)   like if you rushed into a store with a gun to rob it and had to retreat after slipping on the freshly mopped floor. To Trump, your intentions nor the gun matter   only that it didn t benefit you.This sort of thing doesn t happen with respectable politicians. When a Russian ambassador reached out to John F. Kennedy and his democratic primary opponent Adlai Stevenson in 1960, both candidates rebuked him.This is not normal. This is not acceptable. Trump must be impeached before the damage he does is irreversible.Watch Trump talk out of his ass below:Featured image via screengrab", Trump: ‘Most People’ Would Commit Treason Like My Son If Given The Opportunity (VIDEO)

And since retiring, Letterman hasn t shied away from commenting on Trump s dumpster fire presidency when he is asked about it.During an interview with the Associated Press on Monday, Letterman made it clear that he is sick of Trump s constant whining and offered a brilliant solution. We know there s something wrong, but what I m tired of is people, daily, nightly, on all the cable news shows telling us there s something wrong,  Letterman said before calling for action. I just think we ought to direct our resources and our energies to doing something about it,  Letterman continued.  And other people have made this point: If the guy was running Dairy Queen, he d be gone. This guy couldn t work at the Gap. So why do we have to be victimized by his fecklessness, his ignorance? Indeed, Trump would have been fired long before now and definitely would not have even been hired after many of the things he has said in public. Ordinary American workers would no longer have a job if they repeated some of things Trump has said.Letterman also had a message for Trump s supporters. Letterman said he feels bad for them because they got duped into thinking Trump would be best for America. Letterman said that he wishes Trump would be the one who fixes the problems our country faces. But Trump is not the right person to get the job done. In fact, Trump should be ousted from office and placed  in a home  where he can get the medication he needs whenever he feels the need to rant uncontrollably. But it s just the behavior is insulting to Americans, whether you voted for him or not   and I feel bad for people who did vote for him because he promised them things that they really needed and one wonders if he s really going to come through. I know there s trouble in this country and we need a guy who can fix that trouble. I wish it was Trump, but it s not, so let s just stop whining about what a goon he is and figure out a way to take him aside and put him in a home.

It s remarkable really because Gorka is  fake.  Even his PhD is fake and yet, he used to insist that everyone call him  Doctor.  Still yet, the fake doctor couldn t help himself and launched into a rant against  fake news. It s laughable. Your chryon talked about a  crisis,  Gorka told Cooper in response to a suggestion that the White House was in turmoil.  I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House, it is absolutely nothing of the kind. The president is a steam locomotive that can t be stopped. It s just fake news. I m sad to see CNN fall to this,  Gorka said.  I know you want salacious and sensational coverage for your ratings so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money, but that s not media, that s not reportage. It s just fake news. Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it really gets us anywhere,  Cooper shot back.Cooper pressed Gorka over a tweet which Trump posted on Twitter saying the media often makes up its sources, despite the fact that Trump Jr. released the email chain which confirms The New York Times  reporting.Remember, when you hear the words ""sources say"" from the Fake Media, often times those sources are made up and do not exist.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2017 I m giving you an opportunity right now to correct what the president said this morning. Because what he s alleging is that the reporting is fake and in fact, his son s own email chain shows that it s accurate. Do you deny that?  Cooper asked. No, I deny the fact that there is anything here that is untoward. Again this is an obsessive nine-month campaign,  Gorka said.An exhausted Gorka eventually said,  I thought we were going to talk about real issues, like what we re doing with our allies in France, defeating ISIS. I am going to ask you but you re not being honest, you re not being upfront,  Cooper responded. How many minutes are we in?  Gorka said. Are you a TV producer now?  Cooper fired back.  You re concerned about how many minutes we ve been talking? Do you have somewhere else to go? If you gotta go, you gotta go. You re falling into the fake news trap again,  said Gorka.  And it s sad, Anderson. You re shaking shiny objects to try to divert people, but I don t think viewers are really that easily diverted,  Cooper said. Do you know why the president s description of a witch hunt is accurate,  Gorka asked.  Because there never were witches. And there never was any collusion. It s bogus   Anderson, you re like a broken record. No, because I m not getting any answers from you,  replied Cooper. I m answering it. Every time,  said Gorka. No, you re responding,  said Cooper.  You re not actually answering because you re not actually being up front. Let s let the viewers judge,  Gorka said, who then mocked CNN s ratings. You used that line on Monday, and you know, it was sort of mildly amusing,  Cooper said.  But I think it s funny that you have enough time in the White House, which is apparently you re so busy, you re able to sit around [and] read Nielsen numbers. No, I had really good prep from my team, because the White House press team is superb,  Gorka said.  I don t deal with this stuff because I do have a day job.

1,Fake,"July 13, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s White House is in more turmoil than ever, as it turns out that Donald Trump Jr. just provided the entire world with email evidence that he was more than willing to collude with a Russian national to try and fix an election by collecting dirt on 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Ever since the fact that Trump Jr. met with a shady Russian lawyer came out, everyone in Trump World has been spinning madly in order to try and make all of this potentially criminal activity seem like it means nothing. More than anything, they have lied through their teeth to do so. Well, there is one person who is willing to call them out for being lying liars: Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island.Senator Whitehouse appeared on MSNBC s All In with Chris Hayes on Wednesday evening, and ripped the folks in Trump World a new one on this issue. He also said that the Trump Jr. emails take on a new legal meaning   and that it means people need to stop talking to the press and start talking under oath. Of course, for pathological liars, this is a huge deal, because lying under oath is a crime.Senator Whitehouse said to host Chris Hayes: If there s been a legal violation here   and this very strong indications that there has   then you re dealing with things like indictments, and the House potentially beginning impeachment proceedings, and people having to start talking under oath, instead of you know, talking out on the airwaves, where they lie as easily as they breathe. BOOM! That is exactly what we need to hear. These people are covering something up, and that becomes more evident by the hour.

1,Fake,"July 13, 2017",News,"California Democratic Representative Brad Sherman has decided that enough is enough and has taken matters into his own hands.Sherman believes Donald Trump committed obstruction of justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey during the agency s investigation into Russia s ties to the US election and has filed the first formal article of impeachment against the President of the United States.The United States Constitution states that impeachment of a President is a possibility if guilty of  treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors  and obstruction of justice just happens to be a felony under federal law.Sherman said in a statement issued on Wednesday that he doesn t expect impeachment to happen right away, rather that he is trying to promote the idea of an intervention in the White House. For Trump to actually be impeached, articles must pass the House with a majority vote   something that will be borderline impossible in a Republican-controlled chamber.There is hope, however, as Texas Republican Representative Al Green has publicly expressed his support for the impeachment of President Trump, so hopefully, others might follow suit.Sherman s article lists other actions that President Trump has allegedly taken, besides the Comey firing, that could potentially be grounds for his impeachment. These include James Comey s allegation that Trump asked him to  let this go  in reference to an FBI investigation into Michael Flynn, the former National Security Advisor, and his ties to Russia.Comey s firing is still the cornerstone of the article. With Sherman claiming that Trump did so in relation to the handling of the Russia investigation, the California Representative might have a valid point   namely the President telling NBC s Lester Holt,  When I decided to just do it, I said to myself   I said, you know, this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.

His mind even manufactures people, like his former spokesman John Barron, who was actually Trump. Since the campaign trail, though, Trump has been talking about his friend  Jim,  and much like John Barron, Jim doesn t appear to exist.A few weeks ago, the New York Times published an incredibly long and comprehensive list of all the lies Donald Trump has told, just since taking office. That was a few weeks ago, though   before the G20 and before he claimed his son had a meeting with Russians about his campaign and that Trump Sr. knew nothing about it.Between Trump s regular pattern of lying and the fact that he already has a pattern of making people up, it shouldn t be a surprise that the media hasn t been able to find his friend Jim. Oh, and by the way, Jim is kind of a xenophobic asshole.The way Trump tells it   Jim is a friend who loves Paris and used to visit every year. Yet when Trump travels to the city Thursday for his first time as president, it s unlikely that Jim will tag along. Jim doesn t go to Paris anymore.

Steve King (R-IA) went on CNN to propose a heartless, revolting solution to getting Trump s border wall paid for. King is apparently accepting Mexico s refusal to pay for Trump s moronic border wall (even as Trump still insists that the country will pay) and has come up with another solution   cutting food assistance to low-income Americans! And while he s at it, he d also like to slash Planned Parenthood funding.This disgusting suggestion came up when Alisyn Camerota asked King if he would be  comfortable with providing $1.6 billion of taxpayer money not from Mexico to bill that wall?  This question was prompted by the House Republicans  threat to Democrats on Tuesday, where they suggested a government shutdown if $1.6 billion for the border wall wasn t included in the 2018 budget. King responded: Absolutely yes and more. And I d throw another $5 billion on the pile, and I would find half of a billion of dollars of that right out of Planned Parenthood s budget. And the rest of it could come out of food stamps and the entitlements that are being spread out for people who have not worked in three generations. Camerota, of course, was speechless. She did a double take and asked: You want to take food from people who are on the lowest rung in terms of the nation s safety net and their children, in terms of foot stamps you re happy to take money from them in order to give the $1.6 billion for the border wall? King tried to defend himself, stating that the border wall would create jobs. Then, he jumped to the school lunch program that Michelle Obama had created. He said: I would just say let s limit it to that anybody who wants to have food stamps, it s up to the school lunch program, that s fine. You can watch King turn into an absolute piece of sh*t below:These food stamps   provided by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)   are responsible for assisting 45 million people. Trump has already proposed that this program be cut 25% over the next 10 years, and King wants to cut it even more to support an ineffective border wall that most Americans strongly oppose.

1,Fake,"July 12, 2017",News,"Since Donald Trump s November 8 election victory, there has been a significant rise in hate-based threats and attacks in the United States, with the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) documenting 1,863 such incidents between then and April, at least 330 of which took place on college campuses. In fact, in the 10 days following the election, there was an average of 87 incidents per day!At the peak of these occurrences immediately following the election, there was a 500 percent spike in bias-based incidents when compared to daily hate crimes reported by the FBI for all of 2015. To be completely honest, these types of incidents have decreased slightly in recent months, but the most troubling part of this whole situation is the increase in the severity of the attacks.What makes these incidents even more frightening is the sheer amount that occur on college campuses, thanks mostly to an upsurge in white supremacists campaigning and recruiting in American colleges. It is getting so bad that the SPLC has documented more than 135 incidents of white supremacist and nationalist recruitment efforts on US campuses since the commencement of the 2016 academic year. It s a definite uptick, and they ve been making a concerted effort to flyer and paper as many campuses as they possibly can,  says Lecia Brooks, the SPLC s outreach director, adding that the campaigning has notably increased since Trump s Presidential victory. It shouldn t be hidden,  Brooks said in reference to incidents documented at schools across the entire country.  The [university] administrations should always issue a strong statement of condemnation clearly stating who they [white supremacist groups] are and what they represent, encouraging students to disregard their recruitment [drives] and disavow their message. The result of these recruitment efforts is a huge escalation in hate-based incidents on college campuses, including Tommy Curry, an African-American philosophy professor at Texas A&M University, constantly receiving death threats via email and voice messages, the stabbing death of Richard W Collins, an African-American Bowie State University student, while visiting the University of Maryland and the election of Taylor Dumpson, American University in Washington DC s first African-American, female student-government president, being met with nooses tied around the campus with bananas labeled  Harambe Bait.

1,Fake,"July 11, 2017",News,"For someone who is as vocal and outspoken as Donald Trump on social media, he has shockingly thin skin. Trump has been known to hide and run away from protesters both on and offline, unable to take the much-needed criticism that Americans are trying to offer. Because of Trump s fragile ego, it has been quite common for Trump to block other Twitter users for simply expressing their First Amendment rights. This habit, however, has landed Trump in deep sh*t. He s now being sued for it!On Tuesday, Trump and his top White House officials were sued by the Knight First Amendment Institute for blocking Twitter users simply because they were criticizing him. The case, which was filed in Manhattan federal court, states that this violates the Constitution and calls for Trump to stop blocking dissenting Americans immediately.Trump had been warned that this would happen. In June, the Knight First Amendment Institute sent a letter to Trump, his counsel, press secretary, and social media director, stating that they were representing two Twitter users that had been blocked after criticizing Trump. Trump failed to listen, and now the Institute is representing five more Twitter users who have been treated this way by the President.The complaint states that Trump s Twitter account is  a public forum under the First Amendment  because he and his staff are using it to make presidential announcements and constantly use it to communicate with the American people. Press secretary Sean Spicer has also called Trump s tweets  official statements  in the past.The complaint also states that Trump s blocking  imposes an unconstitutional restriction on their right to access statements that defendants are otherwise making available to the public at large. It also imposes an unconstitutional restriction on their right to petition the government for redress of grievances. Jameel Jaffer, the Knight Institute s executive director, said: President Trump s Twitter account has become an important source of news and information about the government, and an important forum for speech by, to, or about the president. The First Amendment applies to this digital forum in the same way it applies to town halls and open school board meetings. The White House acts unlawfully when it excludes people from this forum simply because they ve disagreed with the president. The Knight Institute is calling on the court to declare Trump s viewpoint-based blocking  unconstitutional, force Trump to unblock the plaintiffs and have Trump pay for their legal fees.It s about time something like this caught up with Trump. He s conducted himself as the least transparent, and less interested POTUS when it comes to listening to the American people. He tries to silence and drown out all of the dissenting voices around him, instead of actually considering that there might be a reason behind his historically low approval rating. Trump is not a dictator, and he cannot take away Americans  First Amendment rights, not even when their free speech opposes him.

Trump Jr. asked to see the information (solicitation), and such information would be considered to be a  thing of value.  It s both illegal to solicit and it s illegal for a campaign to accept a things of value from foreign entity, and it s hard to dispute that such  dirt  on an opponent wouldn t be a thing of value.A foreign national shall not, directly or indirectly, make a contribution or a donation of money or other thing of value, or expressly or impliedly promise to make a contribution or a donation, in connection with any Federal, State, or local election.This won t be the final shoe to drop, though.

1,Fake,"July 11, 2017",News,"During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump constantly made references to repealing and replacing  the disaster that is Obamacare  and Democrats collectively shuddered. We all knew that nothing good could come of this.Now after six months in office, despite discovering that nobody knew healthcare could be so difficult, President Trump is about to deliver on his campaign promise as the Senate returns from a one-week recess to get back to the task at hand; trying to come to an agreement on their new healthcare bill known as the Better Care Reconciliation Act (BCRA), one that they have predominately kept the public in the dark about.Things are looking bleak, however, as even the Republican party remains divided on a bill that is not only going to raise out-of-pocket costs and restrict access to services for many, but also cause tens of millions to lose their health insurance completely over the coming decade.These charts might be able to put the entire healthcare debacle into perspective:1. We All Know The Short-Term Medicaid Cuts Are Going To Suck: The new health care bill will save a ton of money, but roughly a quarter of those savings, or approximately $770 billion over the next decade, come from cuts to Medicaid. The result is that 15 million less people will be enrolled in Medicaid under the new GOP bill than compared to Obamacare:2. If You Thought That Was Bad, The Long-Term Effects Are Even Worse: The inflation rate for Medicaid spending beginning in 2025 is much slower, affecting those who rely on it the most, mainly children, the disabled, and the elderly. In fact, by 2036 federal Medicaid spending on children will be reduced by almost a third and by a quarter for the disabled and the elderly when compared to the current law according to an analysis by the health consulting firm Avalere Health:3. The Percentage Of Those Uninsured Will Rise In Every Single Age Bracket: That s right, under the BCRA 22 million people will lose their insurance (compared to 23 million under the version passed by the house) and every single age group will be affected, according to an assessment by the Congressional Budget Office:4. It Will Also Rise In Every State, Including Those Whose Overwhelming Majority Voted For Trump: Yes, the new bill will drive up the uninsured rate by at least 21% and even up to 300% in every state by 2022, a new study by the Urban Institute found:5. The Older and Poorer You Are, The More You Will Be Paying For Insurance Premiums If an analysis by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities is to be believed, health insurance premiums are going to go through the roof, but those hit the worst will be older Americans:6. The Older Middle Class Will be Hit Pretty Hard Too, As Their Tax Credits Will Go Through The Floor: The Center for Budget and Policy Priorities  analysis also found that the tax credits that are available to help older people in the individual market afford health insurance are going to do just the opposite and plummet:7. Even Employer Plans Aren t Immune: The GOP s new bill cuts to Medicaid and individual market subsidies have given the 150 million Americans that receive their health insurance through their employer a false sense of security, but they re not safe, either. Not only will the new legislation bring back annual and lifetime limits in employer plans, as well as end penalties for companies that don t provide health insurance to their workers, but it will also allow employers to shift much of the cost of copays, deductibles and coinsurance onto their workers. The Center for American Progress calculated how many will feel the crunch:8. Hospitals Are Going To Feel The Crunch As Well: Hospitals aren t happy with the new bill and it is easy to see why, when you consider it will cause a large spike in uncompensated care for hospitals across all states: 9. Finally, The New Bill Will Cause Massive Job Loss, Particularly In The Health Care Sector: By 2026, more than 1.45 million jobs will be lost as a direct result of the BCRA go by the results of a report by the Commonwealth Fund and George Washington University. In fact, the report goes as far as to say that Every state except Hawaii would have fewer jobs and a weaker economy,  however, it s not just health care employment that will be affected, but also retail and construction as well:So if you thought this latest rewrite of the GOP s health care legislation didn t affect you, you more than likely thought wrongly. Even if it isn t your health care that is directly affected, chances are you will still feel the ripple effects of the bill on the economy, both on a state and national level.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images", These Charts Show Why We’re All Screwed Under The GOP Health Care Bill

The move ended three days of tough negotiations of how to respond to Trump s dubious June 1 decision. This is a clear indication that the U.S. has isolated itself on climate change once again, and is falling back while all other major economies step up and compete in the clean energy marketplace created by the Paris Agreement estimated to be worth over 20 trillion dollars,  said Andrew Light, a senior climate change adviser at the State Department under former President Barack Obama.Initially, the G20 leaders had great difficulty in coming to an agreement on a common text on climate change, with America demanding a reference to fossil fuels. The climate section that was eventually signed off on took note of the US withdrawing from the Paris agreement, with other countries describing it as  irreversible,  yet also optimistically hinting that the country may one day buy back into the pact with references to the US approach to fossil fuels, stating, The United States of America states it will endeavor to work closely with other countries to help them access and use fossil fuels more cleanly and efficiently.

They can try to sugarcoat anything Trump does, but it s hard to put a positive spin on the ramblings of a clearly troubled man.

And some have even been used in court to rule against the White House s attempted Muslim ban.Adding to that, Trump s tweets are a visual, daily reminder that our president is, at his heart, a complete moron.

During one of Trump s latest Twitter meltdowns, a despondent aide sent a reporter a simple message:Informed of the president s denial that he had recorded his conversations with Comey, a senior administration official replied,  At least that s behind us.  When alerted to his apparent suspicions of Oval Office surveillance, the official replied in a text message,  fml. What does Trump think about these attempts to save him from himself? It makes him angry.New York Times reporter Mark Leibovich filed a lengthy piece with a simple premise: The White House is a total-and-unending shitshow and Trump is at the epicenter. Leibovich was, in fact, in the room, when the idea of Trump s Twitter self-sabotage was brought up to the president. Trump s reaction speaks volumes.It was 12:30, but the president was not eating lunch. He was watching a recording of  Fox and Friends  from about four hours earlier on a large TV mounted on the wall. This was one of those stretches when Trump was tweeting a lot, including attacks on the mayor of London following a terrorist attack on the city the previous weekend. The tweets were becoming a growing topic of concern among Republicans, many of whom were urging him to stop. But like most reporters, I found his tweets far more illuminating than anything the White House press office could ever disgorge. I urged him to keep it up.Trump assured me that he would keep tweeting.  It s my voice,  Trump said of Twitter, enumerating how many millions of followers he had.  They want to take away my voice,  Trump said.  They re not going to take away my social media. In just two paragraphs, Leibovich documented Trump s insane Fox News viewing habits, the well-known patent dishonesty of the White House press office, and Trump s own spoiled brat way of looking at his Twitter habits.

Fortunately for him, he had the foresight to hire a criminal defense lawyer before the other shoe dropped.Speaking of shoes dropping, new information has come out about that meeting. Not only did he go there with the intent of getting information about Hillary Clinton from the Russians, Trump Jr. was informed beforehand that the material was part of the Russian government s effort to help install his dad in the Oval Office.The New York Times reports:The email to the younger Mr. Trump was sent by Rob Goldstone, a publicist and former British tabloid reporter who helped broker the June 2016 meeting. In a statement on Sunday, Mr. Trump acknowledged that he was interested in receiving damaging information about Mrs. Clinton, but gave no indication that he thought the lawyer might have been a Kremlin proxy.Mr. Goldstone s message, as described to The New York Times by the three people, indicates that the Russian government was the source of the potentially damaging information. It does not elaborate on the wider effort by Moscow to help the Trump campaign. There is no evidence to suggest that the promised damaging information was related to Russian government computer hacking that led to the release of thousands of Democratic National Committee emails.According to Trump Jr., the meeting did not amount to much. For his light treason, he says, he received no information and they just chatted about an adoption program (yes, that s what he s going with).The adoption program in question was halted by Vladimir Putin in response to the Magnitsky Act, a U.S. law that blacklists Russian human rights abusers. Putin became so incensed that he decided American families may not adopt Russian children.

This was an effort to get opposition research on an opponent in an American political campaign from the Russians, who were known to be engaged in spying inside the United States,  former Bush ethics lawyer Richard Painter said Sunday of Trump Jr. s meeting. We do not get our opposition research from spies, we do not collaborate with Russian spies, unless we want to be accused of treason. If this story is true, we d have one of them if not both of them in custody by now, and we d be asking them a lot of questions,  Painter said.  This is unacceptable. This borders on treason, if it is not itself treason. Trump Jr. doesn t even bother disputing the truthfulness of the story, saying he did indeed collude with the Russians in hopes of gaining  helpful  information about his dad s political opponent. But he says that she had  no meaningful information  so his engaging in a little light treason is not an issue in the least. According to Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump s husband Jared Kushner and Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended the meeting. Trump s son says he  had to listen  even if the meeting  went nowhere :Obviously I'm the first person on a campaign to ever take a meeting to hear info about an opponent  went nowhere but had to listen. https://t.co/ccUjL1KDEa  Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) July 10, 2017Unsurprisingly White House spokesmoron Sarah Huckabee Sanders agrees with Trump Jr. that a little collusion with a Kremlin-connected lawyer isn t a hug deal. In fact, the only real problem is the people who exposed the details, she said during an off-camera press briefing: The only thing I see inappropriate about the meeting was the people that leaked the information on the meeting after it was voluntarily disclosed.

1,Fake,"July 10, 2017",News,"Donald Trump and his favorite daughter, Ivanka, are still getting a lot of heat for the stunt they pulled at the G20 summit in Germany last week. The entire world was shocked when Trump stepped out of the G20 meeting and Ivanka took his seat and sat in for him at the leader s table   a move that earned Trump and his administration a massive amount of criticism and outrage.While most of the country was disgusted that Ivanka, who was not elected or qualified, was allowed to sit next to the attending world leaders, Trump and his daughter found refuge on Fox News  Outnumbered, who passionately defended their favorite dictator and his daughter. Ignoring the fact that this was highly inappropriate, Fox News  Jason Chaffetz and the rest of the Outnumbered panelists were more than happy to defend it. Chaffetz said: Ivanka Trump, she is part of the administration. She does have her father s ear. She can actually get things done. and they were talking about a topic in which she s personally engaged. I think it was wholly appropriate. If that wasn t ridiculous enough, the segment was made far worse by Harris Faulkner, who actually said that Ivanka was qualified to be at the G20 meeting because her products were  hot online.  Faulkner said: It must be so frustrating for Democrats not to have any low hanging fruit. They re grasping now. They re really grasping. She is there in a capacity of someone who has run a very successful corporation and her items are selling by the way, hot online. It really does not get any dumber than that   especially considering that Ivanka s brand has seen a major decline since her father s presidential campaign and failing presidency ruined the family s name and reputation.

Court documents state that lawyers affiliated with the case are recommending Rote face up to two years of probation with community service on the side. Further: Rote told police why she tried to vote more than once. She was convinced her first vote for Mr. Trump would be manipulated and changed to a vote for then-Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. According to her statement to the police, Rote believed Mr. Trump s claims about widespread election rigging. So, if you thought Trump lying to his supporters didn t actually have an effect on them, you would be wrong. His lies not only were inaccurate but got this gullible voter in a lot of trouble.The irony of all of this is beyond hilarious considering we were all told by Trump that it was the liberals who were up to no good. And by saying it was the liberals who were up to no good caused his own supporters to literally be up to no good and attempt to tamper with election results thus resulting in a guilty plea.Between this and the Russia scandal, it s more than obvious the actual criminal was put in office by the Electoral College.Featured Image by Getty Images", Trump Supporter Pleads Guilty To Tampering With Election Results In Iowa

The defendants are a who s who of people who have gotten in Trumps way. He accused Hillary of a series of unsubstantiated, often-vague crimes. He smeared Loretta Lynch. He falsely stated that Obama had illegally wiretapped him. He s slandered James Comey, the man he inappropriately fired for investigating him, on several occasions   all from the platform of his White House-backed Twitter account.After watching a badly-botched Fox and Friends report on the memos Comey wrote, Trump went onto Twitter to accuse Comey of a crime rather than learn the facts.James Comey leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION to the media.

Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman told NBC that nothing he received from Comey was classified, the things he passed along to the press were written accounts of what Comey chatted with Trump about, which is completely legal.No evidence has surfaced supporting that charge. Three of the memos were classified from the beginning, and were never shared with Richman, the professor tells NBC News.Of the remaining four, a small portion   much less than half   has been retroactively deemed classified, said a Congressional source familiar with the matter.What Trump did was take a misleading section of a story, blow it up into something it wasn t and then publicly accuse a former civil servant of committing a serious crime. All based on a botched news report on Fox s morning show.And his words have consequences.In a recent example, Trump sicced his loyalists on reporters for exposing his scandals, members of the media have noted a serious uptick in the number of death threats and slurs hurled at them. After CNN exposed the anti-Semite behind the meme Trump tweeted, Trump fans announced that they would be gathering in front of the reporter s home.

A single tweet from Trump can mean your family receives death threats. Others will call for you to be fired or demand you resign. And you will now be known as a person accused by the president of the United States of a crime.

And now, coming forward is Richard Painter, a former White House ethics lawyer who served under former President George W.

Adding: If this story is true, we d have one of them if not both of them in custody by now, and we d be asking them a lot of questions This is unacceptable. This borders on treason, if it is not itself treason.

And they are words that even Trump can understand. Idiot  is the top word Americans used to answer the poll, followed by  incompetent  and  liar. Americans also used words such as, asshole, unqualified, ignorant, racist, embarrassment, narcissist, bully, arrogant, dishonest, bigot, buffoon, blowhard, clown, and greedy, just to list a few.Adding insult to injury, Trump s approval rating reached a new low in the poll. Only 36 percent approve while 58 percent disapprove.In addition, 61 percent say Trump is not honest and 56 percent say he does not have good leadership skills.The poll also shows that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the way Trump talks about the media 65 percent to 31 percent. Most, 57 percent, also trust the media more than him to tell the truth, a statistic that will likely send Trump off the deep end.Americans also want Democrats to take back control of the Senate.Overall, it s pretty damn clear that the American people loathe Trump. And even though Trump will try to spin the numbers or use Fox News propaganda to dispute them, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll Tim Malloy says Trump really is out of excuses at this point.

Voters, concerned about the integrity of their private information, are being scared off and we have proof:In Colorado, one of the states that is complying with part of the commission request, two clerks have seen a significant increase in voters withdrawing their voter registration, Denver s ABC affiliate reported.In Denver, one clerk has seen a 2,150 percent increase in people withdrawing as voters over the past since July 3 compared to the first non-holiday week before.Colorado allows voters to withdraw online or make their information confidential by paying a fee.While there s no indication of party affiliation, and you can be sure that many were, in fact, removing duplicate registrations (it s not illegal to forget to take yourself off a voter registration when you move, but it is illegal to vote twice, which almost never happens) it s not a big leap to assume that Democrats would be far more concerned about the Republican in office than would Republicans.It has gotten to the point where Republicans can only win on a national basis by cheating and they are getting better and better at it every year. In 2016, it s clear that Hillary Clinton would have won if not for voter suppression efforts that targeted the all-too-important swing states.Think Progress reports:Their systematic disenfranchisement was intentional and politically motivated. In the years leading up to 2016, Republican governors and state legislatures implemented new laws restricting when, where, and how people could vote laws that disproportionately harmed students, the poor, and people of color. In several instances, lawmakers pushing such policies said explicitly that their goal was suppression of voters who favor the Democratic Party.Three such states serve as case studies for the effectiveness of these voting restrictions: Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Florida.All three elected staunchly conservative governors during President Obama s terms. All three implemented voting restrictions that affect millions of people. President Obama won all three states in 2008, and won all but North Carolina in 2012, while Hillary Clinton lost all three of those states this year.Colorado is also a swing state.

1,Fake,"July 9, 2017",News,"The narrative regarding the Trump-Russia connection seems to be  nothing to see here  when it comes to supporters of the so-called  president.  Donald Trump cannot abide anyone even suggesting that he had help to win in 2016, but the amount of smoke there with regards to the Russian hacking is too thick for there to be no fire. Hell, his own son just admitted something extraordinary. Donald Trump Jr. actually came out and said that he, Trump s son-in-law Jared Kushner, and former campaign manager Paul Manafort actually met with a lawyer with connections to the Kremlin.Apparently, this little secret pow wow occurred after Trump clinched the GOP nomination, and long before his many general election controversies, during a time where it seemed sure that he would lose. Of course, Trump Jr. is saying that this meeting had nothing to with the election and everything to do with adopting Russian orphans. He said of the encounter: We primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children that was active and popular with American families years ago and was since ended by the Russian government, but it was not a campaign issue at that time and there was no follow-up. was asked to attend the meeting by an acquaintance, but was not told the name of the person I would be meeting with beforehand. Of course, this is likely a lie. Trump, his kids, and everyone else in his orbit lie routinely. Further, think about who this meeting took place with   Paul Manafort, who was the campaign manager at the time has known ties to pro-Russia Ukrainian politicians that he has worked for in the past. In fact, it is what forced him to abruptly step aside.Further, the lawyer they met with at Trump Tower during the campaign, Natalia Veselnitskaya, is known around circles who promote sanctioning Russia for their many human rights abuses. Veselnitskaya opposes said sanctions, and that was likely her reason for wanting to meet with Team Trump during the campaign. The reason for the bizarre claims about adopting Russian children is the fact that in 2012, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin halted American adoption of Russian children, due to sanctions that specifically related to human rights violations. This was called the Magnitsky Act, after a man who perished in an untimely and shady manner for blowing the whistle on Russian corruption. It makes for a convenient   but hardly believable   cover story.All in all, this is shady and nobody in their right minds believes that Trump Jr., Paul Manafort, or anyone else on that campaign was meeting with a Kremlin backed lawyer over anything but money and sanctions.

Even his own administration is publicly disagreeing with Trump and stating that Russia interfered with the election   and today, Trump s UN Ambassador humiliated him on national television over his infamous denial.In an interview with CNN, UN Ambassador Nikki Haley stated that  everybody knows  that Russia messed around with the election. What she really should have said was, everyone but Trump. Haley said: Everybody knows that Russia meddled in our elections. Everybody knows that they re not just meddling in the United States  election. They re doing this across multiple continents, and they re doing this in a way that they re trying to cause chaos within the countries. And it s not just going to be us saying this.

1,Fake,"July 8, 2017",News,"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has, like the rest of the world, seen the outrage that is Donald Trump occupying the American presidency over the last six months. He likely also has the same disgusted opinion of the job Trump is doing, not to mention his vulgarity, his lies and conspiracy theories, and his all around unfitness for the office he holds. That sort of thing just might be why Prime Minister Trudeau has shown he has no f*cks left to give when it comes to Trump, and has decided that, instead of talking to Trump, he will instead speak to more competent American government officials instead. To that end, Trudeau will become the first Canadian Prime Minister in history to speak to the National Governor s Association. He says of the move: No countries share a closer bond than Canada and the United States. Each day, hundreds of thousands of people cross the border to work, travel or visit loved ones. Ever more integrated supply chains draw our economies closer together, bringing jobs and prosperity to Canadians and Americans alike. I will continue to work with all orders of the U.S. government to create good, middle class jobs on both sides of the border, and to find solutions to the challenges we face together. While Trudeau has, as any dignified leader would,  remained civil with Trump, it is clear that the two will not be close at all. Trudeau sees Trump for the buffoon that he is, and has criticized him for his promotion of crude nationalism, his views on climate change, and other topics.This is a clear signal that Trudeau has no use for Trump. He simply has to tolerate the orange one until he is either removed from office or his term expires. Until then, it seems Trudeau will simply go around Trump and deal with other (read: sane and qualified) United States government officials. Personally, I think it s a wise move, because dealing with Trump would be nothing short of maddening, and it certainly would not serve the interests of people in Canada or anywhere else in the world.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images"," Trudeau HUMILIATES Trump, Openly Prefers To Speak To Other U.S. Officials Instead"

Speaking at a Boy Scouts event in Wisconsin, Ryan told the crowd that he just doesn t have the guts to face his own constituents when he knows they are p*ssed that he s trying to steal their health care. Aside from the obvious security concerns, what we have found is there are people who are trying to come in from out of the district to disrupt town hall meetings and not have a civil discussion, so what I have been doing is looking for new and creative ways to interact with my constituents in a civil way,  Ryan said. That s why I have done a number of telephone town hall meetings, which I find very effective as people don t have to travel. I do office hours. I just did them this morning in Janesville. In addition, I am doing a lot of business ones,  the Speaker said.Ryan said that he has found other ways to meet with his constituents, like the town-hall style meeting he held on Thursday that was closed to the public with only 25 employees of the business he was touring in attendance. I find when you guys are there, people kind of clam up. They get a little nervous, but when you do business town halls without media it is very interactive, so I am finding a lot of different ways to have a good civil dialogue with constituents,  he continued.Ryan then said that if people want to talk to him, that s what his office hours are for, which he explained help keep him safe from all those big, mean protesters. Additionally, if you want to come do office hours, they schedule office hours because I don t want to have a situation where we just have a screaming fest, a shouting fest where people are being bussed in from out of the district to get on TV because they are yelling at somebody. That does nobody any good, and what I want to do is have a civil, good conversation with constituents, and that s why I do all these different things, whether it s planned tours, telephone town halls, office hours and the rest,  he said.So, that s Ryan s master plan to deal with the ever increasing public anger over his plan to take health care from millions.

Giddy with the chance to speak with a global leader whom he truly admired, Trump made Putin meet with him for over two hours, according to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson.Tillerson also reported that Trump brought up the Russian interference in the election, opening the meeting by asking Putin if he d done any meddling. No one knows why the hell Trump would do this, but Putin responded exactly as we all expected him to   by denying it.Reporters at the briefing also seemed stunned that Trump actually thought Putin would admit to such a thing, especially since Trump has defended Russia and denied the interference so extensively, even at the expense of America s intelligence agencies and free press.  Apparently, Trump asked Putin about the election several times, each time getting a denial from Putin. And according to Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, that was all Trump needed to convince him or satisfy his need to prove his own innocence in the Russian scandal.In a report about the meeting, Tillerson said: What the two presidents I think rightly focused on is how to we move forward  Because it s not clear to me that we will ever come to some agreed-upon resolution of that question between the two nations. You can listen to Tillerson s recap of what happened between Putin and Trump below:Putin and Trump s relationship is highly problematic, and their meeting was the focus of the G20 Summit this week.

Buckley Jr. Award for Media Excellence anyway, and a New York Times columnist is having none of it.Bret Stephens is a conservative columnist for the Times, and he thoroughly ripped Hannity in a recent column pointing out exactly why he is unworthy of the award. If we have reached the point where rank-and-file conservatives see nothing amiss with giving Hannity an award named for Buckley, then surely there s a Milton Friedman Prize awaiting Steve Bannon for his insights on free trade,  Stephens wrote.  And maybe Sean Spicer can receive the Vaclav Havel International Prize for Creative Dissent for his role in exposing  fake news.  The floor s the limit. Or, in Hannity s case, the crawl space beneath it. Stephens went on to point out that Buckley once expressed his disgust about Donald Trump, calling him a  demagogue  and a  narcissist.  He warned Americans to not fall into Trump s trap. But conservatives fell for it hook, line, and sinker. Hannity fell even harder for it, going so far as to lob softball questions at him and then defend him on a daily basis. Hannity even committed hypocrisy by defending Trump for doing all of the things he complained about President Obama doing. When Hannity peddles conspiracy theories about Seth Rich, the young Democratic National Committee staffer murdered in Washington last year, that s an echo of John Birch,  Stephens continued. And so we reach the Idiot stage of the conservative cycle, in which a Buckley Award for Sean Hannity suggests nothing ironic, much less Orwellian, to those bestowing it, applauding it, or even shrugging it off. The award itself is trivial, but it s a fresh reminder of who now holds the commanding heights of conservative life, and what it is that they think.

The world strongly disagrees with him. Trump has been in office for only 168 days and yet he has already had a major impact on how the world sees the United States.MSNBC s Chris Matthews highlighted a new Pew Research Center poll which shows that Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.Trump is wildly unpopular worldwide while Obama s popularity soars above the former reality show star s ratings. 37 nations were included in the poll, showing that a median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. In contrast to the final years of Barack Obama s presidency, a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump s predecessor to direct America s role in the world.Watch: This highlights why Trump has exhibited so much jealousy toward his popular predecessor. Trump will never be respected like Obama was and is. Trump s jealously toward Obama was displayed long before he took the oath of office. Obama would never bash the U.S. media and intelligence agencies while on foreign soil. In fact, he never did that in the U.S., but Trump does and did. Obama retaliated against Russia s meddling in our 2016 presidential election by ordering 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country. Obama imposed sanctions against the foreign hostile government, while Trump s administration would like to lift them.The former reality show star is  fake news  and that can be seen daily in his Twitter timeline but he is good at projection.By the way, Trump is not expected to confront Russian leader Vladimir Putin today at the G20 summit meeting about his country s interference in our presidential election.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images."," The World To Trump: F*ck Off, You Did Not ‘Inherit A Mess’ From Obama (VIDEO)"

Sharia Law anyone?According to numerous reporters, women have been barred from the Speaker s lobby for wearing sleeveless dresses and blouses. CBS reports that recently,  a young, female reporter  tried to enter the Speaker s lobby a room outside of the House chamber where reporters generally ask legislators questions but was turned away because the sleeveless dress she was wearing  was considered inappropriate because her shoulders weren t covered. The unnamed reporter, apparently desperate to simply do her job,  ripped out pages from her notebook and stuffed them into her dress s shoulder openings to create sleeves,  CBS reports. Her improvised outfit was still deemed unacceptable and she was turned away. At least three reporters confirmed that they had received a warning about the apparently arbitrary dress code. One report, Independent Journal Review s Haley Byrd told CBS that she was kicked out of the Speaker s lobby in May the same day House Republicans passed their health care bill for wearing a sleeveless dress.

It s not a big leap, though, to say that they are trying to de-sexualize women.

Right now, he is in Europe for the incredibly important G-20 Summit, in which he is sharing a stage with people who are, well, qualified to be world leaders, whereas he clearly is not. It s also no secret that all of those leaders think he is a fool and a buffoon. As if that wasn t bad enough, Trump also spent his time bashing the American free press in a joint press conference with the Polish president. He also went after the intelligence community, and of course, couldn t resist taking a few shots at President Obama.Now, those things are already seriously problematic. However, the real, visible shocker came as Trump finished his speech on the stage in Poland   in front of a crowd the Polish government had bussed in to cheer for Trump because they are aware of how fragile his ego is. When he was done speaking, Trump walked from behind the bullet proof barrier that was there to protect his life. But instead of walking off the stage or going toward his security detail, he just wandered around looking confused, clearly unsure of what to do next. Finally, he just stood there like a deer in headlights.Now, I am no doctor, and far be it from me to diagnose the man with anything. I won t do that. But something seems to be seriously wrong there. That s not just Trump s rank incompetence. That s clear confusion. He literally had no clue what was going on around him or what he was supposed to be doing.

In a confession that would make Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan go into hiding, Toomey admitted: I didn t expect Donald Trump to win. I think most of my colleagues didn t. So we didn t expect to be in this situation. Trump himself hasn t made this easy for the GOP, as he continues to change his mind about the bill. Not long after he praised the House s version of the bill during a ceremony, he called the plan mean. Toomey also spent time during the town hall criticizing Trump for his attacks on the media, particularly MSNBC s Morning Joe hosts. Toomey said: Every President has had tension with the press. I think it s best to ignore it. Toomey made it perfectly clear that he s not really a fan of Trump s, and it might have been wishful thinking on his part that Trump wouldn t get elected and we would instead be calling Hillary Clinton  POTUS.

[ ]The Hamburger Abendblatt, a local news outlet, reported that the US government wanted to accommodate Trump in the Four Seasons, but it was already booked. In fact, it turns out that every luxury hotel in Hamburg was reportedly booked by the time the Americans called, leaving Trump, who is associated with an empire of hotel properties, scrambling for a place to stay.The summit was scheduled in February 2016, but his team apparently forgot to book a room. By the time they thought about it, they were screwed. At one point, having run out of options,  there were even rumors Trump might have to sleep in Berlin and have to fly to Hamburg via helicopter. Luckily for Trump and his incompetent staff, the City of Hamburg came to his rescue and decided to put him up for the night in the Senate guest house. So far, no one has revealed if the city is expecting payment for Trump s last minute accommodations.The world leaders attending the G20 summit, along with their staff and security details, take up an estimated 9,000 hotel rooms. It s the kind of thing you have to plan in advance. Trump probably thought that hotels would be scrambling to accommodate him because he is just ever so important, but he got a rude awakening and found out that he isn t nearly as important as he thinks he is.

Mr. Trump s Justice Department will decide whether to approve the merger, and while analysts say there is little to stop the deal from moving forward, the president s animus toward CNN remains a wild card.Source: NY TimesWhat s particularly interesting about this is that it comes at the exact same time as the right is accusing CNN of extortion. As you probably recall, Trump tweeted a GIF of him in a wrestling match beating the crap out of a man whose face had been covered by the CNN logo.CNN found the source of that GIF, which was a middle-aged man who has a habit of posting racist and anti-semitic posts on Reddit. Right-wingers were opposed to this statement from CNN:In the story, reporter Andrew Kaczynski wrote that CNN had found   but would not identify   the Reddit user, whose other posts included racist and anti-Semitic memes,  [b]ecause he is a private citizen who has issued an extensive statement of apology, showed his remorse by saying he has taken down all his offending posts, and because he said he is not going to repeat this ugly behavior on social media again. But it was the next line that would leave the pro-Trump internet inflamed and the journalism community scratching its head:  CNN reserves the right to publish his identity should any of that change.

1,Fake,"July 6, 2017",News,"Republicans were crossing their fingers that Donald Trump s visit to Europe would go better than the last time, but the fates were not on their side. In just one day, Trump became a laughing stock over a failed handshake with Poland s First Lady and told the Polish people that the horrors they suffered during WWII were just  tough. He also managed to piss off the leaders of Poland s Jewish community by snubbing the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial.Visiting the memorial is a time-honored tradition when U.S. presidents visit Poland, but Trump decided he would just skip it. The Warsaw Ghetto Memorial honors the 750 Jews who lived in the ghetto and fought the Nazis in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising when they came to drag every resident of the ghetto off to concentration camps in 1943.While Trump didn t bother to visit the memorial dedicated to the Jews that fought, he did find time to visit the Warsaw Uprising Monument, which honors the Polish resistance fighters who fought the Nazis in 1944, rather than the Jewish fighters from the ghetto.Leaders of Poland s Jewish community were not amused with Trump s decision to omit the Warsaw Ghetto Memorial from his itinerary. A scathing statement signed by Anna Chipczynska, President of the Jewish Community of Warsaw, Les aw Piszewski, President of the Union of the Jewish Communities in Poland, Michael Schudrich, Chief Rabbi of Poland, reads:Ever since the fall of Communism in 1989, all US presidents and vice-presidents visiting Warsaw had made a point of visiting the Monument to the Heroes of the Warsaw Ghetto. They did this in the name of the American people, who had played such a central role in bringing down Fascism, and in that of the universal commemoration of the victims of the Shoah, and condemnation of its perpetrators, that people of all nationalities and religions express. For the Jews of Poland, rebuilding in a democratic Poland their communal life, after the horror of the Shoah and the devastation of Communism, this gesture meant recognition, solidarity and hope. We deeply regret that President Donald Trump, though speaking in public barely a mile away from the Monument, chose to break with that laudable tradition. We trust that this slight does not reflect the attitudes and feelings of the American people.Ivanka Trump, who is Jewish, did visit the memorial and laid a wreath at the site.It was a deeply moving experience to be able to visit The Monument to the Ghetto Heroes and the POLIN Museum of the History of the Polish Jews.

In fact, Poland lost the highest percentage of citizens during the war and its population did not recover until the 1970s.On top of that, Poland went from suffering under Nazi rule to suffering under Soviet rule. The Soviets sent Poles to gulags throughout the Soviet Union. Communism would dominate Poland until the free elections of 1989, and after that, communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union itself collapsed.The utter devastation suffered by Poland demands proper recognition. And Trump proved that he is incapable of expressing true sadness about such a human tragedy.During his speech to the people of Poland, Trump spoke of Poland s tragic history as if it was simply an everyday hardship like having one s car stolen or breaking a leg and having no health insurance. In 1939 you were invaded yet again, by Nazi Germany from the west, and the Soviet Union from the east. That s trouble. That s tough. Here s the video via VidMe. Tough  is not the appropriate word to describe what the Polish people went through during World War II.Hitler literally planned to wipe out the entire Polish people from existence and tried to do exactly that.

1,Fake,"July 5, 2017",News,"Donald Trump s obsession with Twitter and inability to concentrate on any concept more complex than a sentence or two is now being put to use by his desperate staff.Trump is about to embark on a high-stakes, crucial sitdown with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit in Europe. Unfortunately for America, he cannot concentrate on learning anything before he goes. Trump is infamous for refusing to read intelligence briefings (or read anything, really), but his lack of focus has only gotten worse as his poll numbers slide and his petty fights with morning show hosts and his golf trips consume most of his days.His frantic staff is down to one last move to get him to read a few facts before sitting down with Putin. What follows is one of, perhaps, the most pathetic things you ll ever read.Here s what sources told the LA Times about how Trump s team is getting the president to read up on the adversary who interfered in the 2016 presidential election just months ago:The profile, according to two U.S. officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the preparations, is part of a thick binder prepared for Trump. The president often doesn t read the usual briefing books and relies on in-person briefings, the officials said, so aides also have written a list of tweet-length sentences that summarize the main points Trump could bring up with Putin.Having thoroughly killed the reputation of the White House in a variety of ways, Trump now isn t even expected to read anything longer than a tweet. And his Republican allies in Congress don t seem to find anything wrong with that.There is a growing sense, both in Washington and around the country, that the executive branch no longer functionally exists. Trump watches an estimated 5 hours of television a day. He tweets at his enemies, sometimes using memes created by racists and which made their way to his desk in mysterious, disturbing ways. He visits his properties and golfs. The rare time staff can get him to actually work on something gets derailed by Trump s incessant ego and casual obliviousness. His staff is now encouraged to bring up Trump and his election win as often as possible. They are told to not contradict him when he says something factually untrue. Sometimes he ll leave Fox News running in the background while his staff tries to conduct business.Even that was too much work, apparently. Now he needs 140 characters or less or his mind will wander to right-wing memes and personal attacks on his enemies. And he appears to be getting worse.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", WH Starts Condensing Intel Briefings Into Tweet Form In Desperate Move To Get Trump To Read Them
1,Fake,"July 5, 2017",News,"From day one of Donald Trump s failure of a presidency, it was perfectly clear that the former reality television star thought he was a king and expected America to roll over and do whatever the hell he wanted. Unfortunately for the unworthy POTUS, his presidency is panning out a lot differently than he imagined, and he s just been sent another great big  f*ck you  by the United States.Trump s voter fraud conspiracy has just been dealt a major blow and suffered a humiliating defeat, as every single state in America is refusing to give up the voter data that Trump is demanding. According to The Washington Post: In a rare display of bipartisanship, officials in nearly every state have said they will partially or fully refuse to comply with President Trump s voting commission, which has encountered criticism and opposition after issuing a sweeping request for voter data nationwide. Even as some of the resistance centers on Trump and members of his commission, the broader responses from the states indicate a strong and widespread belief that local officials should be managing elections and that the White House s request for volumes of information went too far. That s right   America as a whole united and agreed that what Trump wanted was unconstitutional or illegal, and made moves to protect Americans  private data. This is not only extremely embarrassing for Trump, but it also reveals that his administration is increasingly lazy and sloppy, having not even bothered to look and see if their request for the voter data was legal by state law!Unlike Trump and his incompetent team, the majority of America is not so reckless and willing to bow down to a complete idiot. This will go down in the books as yet another one of Trump s failures, as he is once again defeated by the checks and balances he thought he could overrun with his dictator-style  leadership.

1,Fake,"July 5, 2017",News,"Donald Trump has been notorious for touting poll numbers that look good for him. During the campaign, whenever he d careen into one of his many controversies and the numbers dipped, he and his mouthpieces would reference junk polls to show that people still loved The Donald. Of course, any poll that can be voted in a million times online is bogus. However, factual data isn t bogus, and that data does not look good for Trump right now. In fact, a new poll shows that way more Americans want Trump removed from office than the number of people who think he s doing a good job.According to new data from Public Policy Polling, 47 percent of Americans see Donald Trump as the incompetent, dangerously unstable buffoon he is, and want him impeached posthaste. On the other hand, just 37 percent believe he is actually a good president. That isn t surprising; after all, the slavish, blind devotion of his mouthbreathing base has not been a secret for nigh on two years now.On the other side of said insane base, there were marches around the nation for the holiday weekend demanding Trump s removal and protesting his administration and their policies. Further, more Democrats are becoming emboldened by these numbers and are actually drafting articles of impeachment. One such Democrat is Rep. Brad Sherman (D-CA). Speaking in his home district in Los Angeles, Rep. Sherman egged the anti-Trump crowd on, saying: We have to act now to protect our country from abuse of power and impulsive, ignorant incompetence. At this declaration, the crowd borrowed from Trump s own base, and shouted back:  LOCK HIM UP! Of course, there s one little difference between Trump s base and the Democrats   there s PLENTY of evidence to suggest that Trump is a criminal, while there is absolutely none to suggest the same about Hillary Clinton.Of course, there will be no impeachment until the Democrats take back the House of Representatives, and there will be no invocation of the 25th Amendment to remove and unfit  president  from office for the sake of the nation. Therefore, we MUST turn out in 2018, and make sure we control both chambers of Congress. That s the only way we get real, credible Congressional investigations into the Russia ordeal, and it s the only way we get rid of Trump and his criminal administration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images", New Poll: WAY More Americans Want Trump Impeached Than Approve Of The Job He Is Doing

Trump, a  man  who seeks constant adoration, found a safe place with Poland, likely because of the governing party s nationalistic ideology.Trump has a lot in common with Poland s leaders. They oppose immigration, they hold doubts about climate change and don t intend to give up on coal-generated energy.The Associated Press reports that Poland s government will alleviate Trump s hurt fee-fees over possibly not being welcomed by the country s people.The White House received a promise from Poland s government that Trump will be well received and to accomplish that, crowds will be bussed in by pro-government activists to cheer for the so-called president of the U.S.The Wall Street Journal reports:Like many of his fellow Polish pro-government lawmakers, Dominik Tarczynski is sending a busload of constituents to Warsaw on Thursday to cheer for President Donald Trump.

1,Fake,"July 5, 2017",News,"Gas prices are expected to rise sharply this year, but Donald Trump thinks a ten-year low for a single day is something he should get credit for.On July 4th, gas prices dropped to an average $2.23 a gallon. It s the lowest it has been on Independence Day in ten years.So, of course, Trump bragged about it.Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2017Keep in mind, we are only halfway through 2017, and one day does not equal one year.Also, presidents do NOT control gas prices, something conservatives are always hypocritically pointing out when gas prices come down during a Democratic presidency or when gas prices are high during a Republican presidency. But when gas prices are low during a Republican presidency, conservatives throw that knowledge out the window and claim that the president did it.Such is the case now.But Trump had nothing to do with current gas prices. You see, the market has been flooded with oversupply from OPEC, which has driven the price of gasoline down over the last couple years.In 2015, the national average price of gas dropped from $3.37 in 2014 to $2.35.And last year s Independence Day saw a gas price of $2.26 per gallon. That s a mere three cent difference from the low that Trump bragged about yesterday.You didn t hear conservatives giving President Obama credit for that. Nor did they give Obama credit for the even lower national average of $2.20 per gallon in November 2016.But, again, oversupply is the reason why we have cheaper gas right now. Once that supply is burned off, the price of gas will go back up and there s nothing Trump can do about it. One thing he will do, however, is blame anyone and anything else for the rise. He certainly won t be taking credit or bragging.Featured image via Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images", Trump Brags About Gas Prices And Gets HUMILIATED With Facts

In later messages between Andrea and her cousin, Collin Bond, she also revealed that Manafort s marriage was in trouble, but a  public divorce  was not an option because Manafort had  too many skeletons  and  his work and payment in Ukraine is legally questionable.

1,Fake,"July 4, 2017",News,"The Republican effort to impeach former President Bill Clinton is coming back to haunt them.Back in 1998, Republicans passed articles of impeachment against Clinton for lying under oath about an extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky. Seriously, they really sought to impeach a sitting president for this.Fast-forward to 2017 and America has been suffering through the Donald Trump circus for six months. He has lied to the American people just about every time he speaks. He launches vicious attacks on the media and individuals. He is actively trying to kill an investigation into his ties with Russia that could reveal collusion during the 2016 Election, committing obstruction of justice along the way. He has violated the Constitution more time than we can count.Yet Republicans in this Congress have absolutely no problem with Trump abusing his power and acting like a petulant child.If Bill Clinton or Barack Obama had done these things, Republicans would have impeached both of them without thinking twice. And they would have successfully ousted them.Former Republican congressman Bob Inglis voted to impeach Clinton nearly 20 years ago, and now he admits that what Trump is doing is far worse than what Republicans tried to impeach Clinton for.During a 1998 interview, Inglis explained his vote by saying that president s need to have moral authority to lead. There are issues around the world that require American leadership,  he said.  The leader of the free world needs moral authority. And we ve got a president who is sorely lacking in that regard. CNN International host Christiane Amanpour reminded Inglis of his words on Monday and he was quick to apply them to the present day. Well, I guess that young guy you were just playing there apparently hadn t seen something called the Donald Trump show because this is much more serious than anything we ever accused Bill Clinton of,  Inglis declared. I mean, Bill Clinton was a problem involving perjury with the underlying matter being a sexual affair. This is something quite different, particularly when it gets into the Russia investigation and the firing of James Comey. These are very serious matters. Inglis also has a problem with Trump s involvement with Russia, his withdrawal of United States participation in the Paris Climate accords, and Trump  sidelining  America in the area of global leadership.Here s the video via Twitter.He voted to impeach Clinton. @bobinglis now says he  apparently hadn t seen something called the Donald Trump Show.  https://t.co/8zWMrwHQ1o  Christiane Amanpour (@camanpour) July 3, 2017Donald Trump should be impeached. His behavior has embarrassed the United States around the world and he has demonstrated clearly that he is unfit to hold office.

1,Fake,"July 3, 2017",News,"White House officials are now saying Trump won t make a trip to England this summer after a hurried, secret plan to sneak the president into the country was leaked to the English press causing widespread outrage.Trump s unpopularity in the United Kingdom is legendary, and his aversion to protesters has caused him to refuse to visit the nation until they can guarantee there won t be mass protests. But his staff apparently came up with a gamble that would allow him to meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May while avoiding the backlash. Unfortunately for him, it fell through almost immediately.Trump wanted to visit his golf course in Scotland (because, of course) while he was in Europe for the G20 meeting and the plan was to have him quietly pop over to London so he could meet with May. To avoid any chance of protests, Trump s staff is said to have warned British officials that the president would only be giving 24-hour notice before dropping by. This way, they reasoned, protesters wouldn t even know he was in the country before he was leaving again.Whitehall sources confirmed the government had been warned that the president could visit Turnberry, one of his two golf resorts in Scotland, during his trip to Europe, between attending the G20 summit in Hamburg and joining celebrations for Bastille Day in France on 14 July.Trump would be expected to come to Downing Street to meet the prime minister for informal talks as part of any such visit, though final confirmation would be likely to be given with just 24 hours  notice to minimise the risk of disruption.But like everything with Trump s flailing administration, the plan leaked to the press and protesters vowed to be ready, even at short notice.So the White House is back to saying he won t be visiting our ally after all. At least not this summer.A spokeswoman for the US president said on Monday that no trip was imminent, amid mounting speculation that Trump was planning to make an unofficial visit to the UK on his way to or from the G20 summit in Hamburg this week. While we look forward to visiting the UK, it will not happen in the next two weeks,  the spokeswoman said.It s doubtful that the White House s denials are going to make any would-be protesters put their guard down. The Trump administration has such a deep reputation of lying, that a denial from them means absolutely nothing. It s likely that angry English citizens will gather at Trump s Scottish golf course while Trump is in Europe juussstttt in case. And Trump has a notoriously hard time resisting a game of golf.Meanwhile, Trump is getting ready to meet his on-again, off-again friend Vladimir Putin at the G20 summit. His advisers told CNN that the president is not planning to bring up the fact that Russia hacked the U.S. elections.

Speaking at the Essence Festival in New Orleans, the California Democrat blasted Carson with the truth: He doesn t give a damn  about people in public housing. [Carson] knows nothing about the mission of HUD. He doesn t care about people in public housing. He believes that if you are poor, it is your own fault. And he doesn t know the difference between an immigrant and a slave. Waters was referring to when Carson put his ignorance on display in March, seemingly unable to tell the difference between  immigrants  and slaves brought here against their will in chains. That s what America is about. A land of dreams and opportunity,  Carson had said.  There were other immigrants who came here in the bottom of slave ships, worked even longer, even harder for less. Carson followed that up by insisting that poverty is really just  a state of mind.  Because of course, it is. Everybody knows that you can feed your children with happy thoughts, right? You take somebody that has the right mindset, you take everything from them and put them on the street and I guarantee in a little while they ll be right back up there,  he said in May.  And you take somebody with the wrong mindset, you can give them everything in the world, they ll work their way right back down to the bottom.

On Monday, Chuck Todd of NBC s Meet The Press pummeled Trump for his latest disgusting tweets and comments against the  fake news  media, and it was exactly what the country needed to hear.Todd s words are incredibly timely, as Trump is now inciting violence against members of the media, directly tweeting videos of himself beating up a reporter from CNN. Todd made note of the fact that Trump has gotten increasingly hostile during his presidency, and his  nasty  attacks on reporters have hit a new low. Todd also pointed out that Trump s administration has gone to great lengths to restrict the press and prevent them from sharing crucial details with the American people.While presidents often face criticism from the press, Todd argued that Trump s relationship with the press is in an unprecedented league of its own   and it s pretty scary. Todd said: If these actions and this language was being used by a leader in a different country, our State Department  would be saying  That country is inching towards authoritarianism.  Because that s usually the first sign: when you try to delegitimize a free press. Todd also slammed Trump for  dehumanizing  people in the media. What the president does with his tweets, and I had this conversation with him, I said don t personalize it. Attack the entities all you want, but when you attack individuals, you dehumanize.

Judging from how Christie has conducted himself over the last few days, he still admires the hell out of Trump.People have been furious with Christie recently, after photos surfaced of him enjoying a New Jersey beach with his family   a luxury that wasn t afforded to any other New Jersey resident. Why not? Because Christie decided to shut down several state parks, beaches, and more over the Fourth of July weekend due to a budget stalemate that Christie was a major part of.In an interview on Monday with Good Day Philadelphia, Christie responded to all of the backlash he s received for enjoying a beach that was closed to everyone else. His response could have been written by Trump himself. He simply said: I m sorry they re not the governor. Over the weekend, Christie had a similar moronic response to his use of the beach house where he was photographed: That s the way it goes. Run for governor, and you can have the residence. Heartless, disrespectful, and despicable   and extremely close to something Trump had said recently when he went off the rails at a rally to honor veterans. Trashing the media, Trump said: I m the president, and they re not. This really isn t a good look for Christie. After all, his approval rating in his final six months in office is pathetically low, at 15%   which is another thing he has in common with the disturbingly unpopular Trump.Voters have been so outraged over this, it s safe to say that Christie won t be New Jersey s governor for long.

1,Fake,"July 1, 2017",News,"One of Donald Trump s biggest fans, Fox News host Sean Hannity, has just tried to come to his rescue after the POTUS was condemned for his disgusting attack on Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.On Saturday, as Trump himself was having a meltdown on Twitter, Hannity decided to join the chaos by defending Trump and his petty, nasty attacks on the Morning Joe hosts. In a disgusting attempt to kiss Trump s *ss, Hannity made an insane threat to the MSNBC news couple, hinting that he had some incriminating dirt on the Morning Joe hosts.No one really knows what the hell  going  there'  actually means, but he s likely trying to channel Trump in his ominous threat   and if he s really trying to emulate Trump, we can bet that he s bluffing.Hannity has a history of going after Scarborough, having previously claimed that Scarborough has many skeletons  in his  closet (& office).  When Hannity had made those statements, he was referring to an incident in which a dead intern was found in Scarborough s district office during his time as a Congressman in 2001. While Scarborough had nothing to do with the intern s death, he resigned from his position due to the conspiracy theories surrounding the incident. Coincidentally, Trump also loves conspiracy theories.While we re not aware of what other nonsense Hannity might want to spread about Scarborough and Brzezinski, is certainly a shame that he s threatening the couple just because they re speaking out against Trump.Hannity s cryptic tweet proves that Fox News and its reporters will do anything to defend Trump, no matter how bad it makes them look. Just last month, Hannity said he would be willing to pay for therapy for the Morning Joe hosts because he felt they d become  unhinged.  Clearly, it s the other way around.Featured image is a screenshot"," Hannity Defends Trump With Psychotic Threat To Morning Joe, This Could Ruin Him (TWEET)"

But somehow, we put him in the White House anyway.This week, Trump attacked MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski, tweeting that he refused to let her hang out with him a few months ago because she was  bleeding badly from a facelift.  And we all know that Trump finds the idea of a woman bleeding out of her wherever  is just too gross for him to handle.Not surprisingly, it turns out that this kind of sexist degradation is a lifelong pattern for Trump. New York Times columnist Gail Collins remembers Trump attacking her in the most degrading way possible.I have to confess I ve overestimated Donald Trump.Back in the day, he sent me a copy of a column he objected to, with some notes suggesting I was a  dog and a liar  with  the face of a pig. I ve had many opportunities to make use of that story since Trump became a presidential candidate, so it s all fine for me. However, I have to admit that it did not occur to me he d keep doing that kind of stuff as president of the United States.This is not normal. A real man would never treat women the way Trump does, calling them  fat pigs  and  dogs  and talking about dating his own daughter. But this isn t even just any man. This is the President of the goddamn United States behaving this way. It is absolutely appalling that this man is supposed to be leading our country, yet this is how he speaks about women.Worse yet, is that this has never been some kind of deep, dark secret.

1,Fake,"July 1, 2017",News,"Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum on Saturday morning because states are refusing to cooperate with his bullshit  voter fraud  panel.As you may recall, Trump created the panel in response to losing the popular vote, which he insists he won because he claims nearly 3 million people voted  illegally. Even Republican secretaries of state know Trump is full of shit, but that s not stopping him from pursuing an investigation anyway.But so far, the panel has turned up nothing. That s because voter fraud is exceedingly rare in this country. In fact, the panel has so little to do that members are requesting that the panel take a look at Russian interference in the 2016 Election, the same Russian interference that helped Trump win.And as it turns out, states are not enthused about handing over voter information to a panel designed specifically to persecute people.In fact, 28 states are refusing to cooperate with the panel s request for the information.According to The Hill, a letter  signed by commission vice chairman and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach (R), asked for names, addresses, birth dates and party affiliations of registered voters in each state. It also sought felony convictions, military statuses, the last four digits of Social Security numbers and voting records dating back to 2006. That s a hell of a lot of information that most voters would see as a violation of privacy if the information were to be released. It seriously sounds like such information would be used to target Democratic voters.The refusal to cooperate sent Trump into a hissy fit in which he actually had the gall to refer to the panel as  distinguished  and accused the 28 states of having something to hide. This coming from a man who is desperately trying to stop the Russia investigation and has repeatedly refused to release his tax returns.Numerous states are refusing to give information to the very distinguished VOTER FRAUD PANEL.

It seems like it s a war against those in a same-sex marriage, even by those in the courthouse. Rather than live and let live, people enjoy making others miserable.What should be the defenders and upholders of justice have let same-sex spouses down in Texas when the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not clearly require states to extend spousal benefits to same-sex couples. This decision came Friday. The ruling was unanimous, making it clear that they do not believe in justice or marriage equality.The Texas Supreme Court interpreted the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges narrowly, questioning whether it compels states to treat same-sex couples equally to opposite-sex couples in any context outside of marriage licensing. I guess we shouldn t expect anything better from Texas.Friday s ruling of Pidgeon v. Turner revolves around spousal benefits for government workers. Texas law prohibits same-sex couples from receiving such benefits. How that is even possible is beyond me.Slate reports that according to the court, Obergefell  did not address and resolve  the  specific issue  of state spousal benefits. Therefore, the state appeals court erred in ordering the trial court to resolve the case  consistent with Obergefell and De Leon.  Instead, the Texas Supreme Court insisted, the trial court must settle the issue itself keeping in mind that Obergefell  did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons. I am flabbergasted. How can judges, meant to serve justice, deny justice? How can they interpret rulings and laws this way? They re bending the ruling to their will because on a personal level they probably don t like same-sex marriage.My heart goes out to all the same-sex spouses that are not receiving fair and equal spousal benefits.Featured image via Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis/Getty Images", Texas Supreme Court Just Proved They Do Not Support Marriage Equality

According to a source speaking with Morrongiello, a panicking Trump marched around the West Wing asking people to reassure him about his tweets. Heaven knows what they said. It s hard to sugarcoat something like this. His tweets were widely condemned by both Republicans and Democrats who recognized that the attack was clearly sexist in nature and  beneath the dignity of the office. It seems likely that Trump s staff reassured him that he was right to say those things, even while privately conceding their boss is nuts. According to sources speaking with the Daily Beast, White House staff are on the verge of mental breakdowns over Trump s behavior, which they are unable to stop:Senior aides to the president have tried and failed for months to find new ways to distract the president from cable-news and social media and bring some level of control to his tweets. On Thursday they responded to the tweetstorm with a mix of resignation and gallows humor.Is Morrongiello s source legit? It seems probable.

1,Fake,"June 30, 2017",News,"The average American makes about $50,000 a year   and too many Americans scrape by on much less. So how much does Trump pay his staff? According to the public filing of payroll released by the White House, an absurd amount, apparently.Since taking office, Trump has staffed his White House with a number of unquestionably unqualified people   including former reality tv stars. His only job requirement is that they be loyal to him   and he measures that loyalty in how well they lie for him on television. The most opportunistic of his staff has risen to that challenge and he subsequently paid them handsomely for the job. Of Trump s staff, a few people stick out for the ridiculous amount of money they make for doing, essentially, nothing:Omarosa, who was hired by Trump because she appeared on  The Apprentice  with him, makes $179,700 per year. It s entirely unclear what she does exactly. Likewise with scandal-laden Seb Gorka, who gets paid $155,000 but legally can t do the job Trump hired him for because he s so shady that intelligence officials wouldn t give him security clearance. Instead, he hangs out at the White House and collects a paycheck.Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer both get paid the same $179,700 that Omarosa does, but that money covers not only their jobs and expenses but also their human dignity. Both Trump staffers are required to repeatedly and shamelessly lie and defend Trump no matter what indefensible thing he said or did. Spicer at least has the decency to look like the toll is killing him inside. Conway appears to actually enjoy the dishonesty, and one suspects she would probably do the job for free if she had to.Hilariously, former Fox News host K.T. MacFarlane gets paid the same amount that Trump s top staff does, including Reince Priebus. She has been sidelined since her friend Michael Flynn was booted from his job and his replacement, H.R. McMasters told Trump he wouldn t take the job unless she was removed. Now she putters around the White House under the vague title  Assistant to the President  doing who knows what. For that, she earns $179,700.The release of the White House payroll only goes to show just how cartoonish Trump s administration is. Filled with disgraced lobbyists, Fox News hosts, former reality tv stars, and a variety of other opportunistic liars, it s no wonder the White House barely functions and is plagued with in-fighting, backstabbing, and scandals.

Trump is sane because they say he is sane and shut up about it.Just hours after Trump got into a public fight with the hosts of  Morning Joe  on Twitter while he watched the show live, Kellyanne Conway went on ABC s  Good Morning America  to say it was unpatriotic to ever question whether Trump has lost his mind. Even while he continues to provide evidence that he has had some sort of mental breakdown.After summarizing an (incomplete) list of the things Trump has been called online, Kellyanne said: It doesn t help the American people to have a president covered in this light. I m sorry. It s neither productive nor patriotic. The toxicity is over the top. In short, Kellyanne wants us to believe Trump is the victim in all of this. Meanwhile, he continues to play the part of the bully.Worth remembering: Trump s favorite network, Fox News, once aired Glenn Beck claiming Obama hated white people. Its star anchor, Sean Hannity, repeatedly accused Obama of being a pathological  narcissist.  And its resident mental health  expert,  repeatedly diagnosed both Barack and Michelle Obama with various pathologies, including once saying Michelle needed to lose weight. None of that irrational hatred or vitriol caused Obama to live-tweet a rant about Fox News hosts or personally smear them on social media.But then, Obama wasn t mentally ill, so why would he?Featured image via YouTube", Conway Declares It ‘Unpatriotic’ To Question Trump’s Mental Health After His Latest Meltdown (VIDEO)

1,Fake,"June 30, 2017",News,"To say people aren t happy is an understatement. People are extremely angry about state Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon shelving the single-payer healthcare bill in California.Huffington Post reports that Rendon has received death threats since making this decision.It is a shame that the bill got shelved as we all wanted to see how California would fare, but nobody should be threatening another life over it. We, as people, are meant to be better than that. Especially those of us with progressive outlooks.Rendon opted to pull the bill last week despite his support for a single-payer system. He called the plan  woefully incomplete.  He urged the state Senate to  fill the holes  and send the Assembly a  workable  bill next year. Even senators who voted for SB 562 noted there are potentially fatal flaws in the bill,  he said in a statement on Friday. These include its failure to address  many serious issues, such as financing, delivery of care, cost controls, or the realities of needed action by the Trump administration and voters  to make the bill  a genuine piece of legislation,  he said.That sounds fair, does it not? If we re going to do something progressive, we need to do it as correctly as possible, not half-baked. Rendon does not sound like he s against the plan.Yet, the death threats poured in. Supporters organized protests at Rendon s district office in Los Angeles County, as well as outside the state capitol in Sacramento. Some single-payer supporters held signs depicting the California state flag s grizzly bear stabbed in the back with a knife that reads  Rendon.  Social media got ugly, as always.I get it. We re all frustrated over the current healthcare situation in America. We all wanted to see how California would do with a single-payer system. It could pave the way for other states and do amazing things for everyone. But I think we should all step back and be rational about things.

1,Fake,"June 30, 2017",News,"The nation is still reeling from the fact that the so-called  president,  Donald Trump, attacked Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski in the most personal, vicious, misogynistic terms ever. However, we should not be surprised. We ve seen the scores of videos of him attacking a former Miss Universe over her weight, of his calling women pigs and dogs, of his making previous  blood  comments about former Fox host and current NBC host Megyn Kelly for asking tough questions about his misogynistic past in a GOP primary debate. We ve listened to Trump boasting of walking into the dressing rooms of teenage beauty pageant contestants. We all heard him brag of sexually assaulting women on the Access Hollywood tape. The  apology  for that damning audio only had Trump apologize in the asinine non-apology of  if anyone was offended,  with a pivot to Bill Clinton s behavior in the 1990 s, culminating in his gross parading of decades old Clinton accusers for debate cameras.Now that Trump is sitting in the Oval Office, Capitol Hill Republicans had no choice but to respond to his behavior. However, they knew what they were getting when they propped him up and got him elected. The #NeverTrump Republicans and assorted conservatives were shunned during the campaign for refusing to support a disgusting man who was so clearly unfit for office and unable to be president of all Americans due to his various bigotries, and for his obvious hatred of women in particular. Yet, they continued, due to the craven urge to put party before country and elect a Republican in order to get a conservative Supreme Court Justice   which materialized in the form of Neil Gorsuch   at the expense of the nation they claim to love. We all knew Trump s unfitness for the office he now holds and the damage he would do to the nation long before his  American Carnage  inauguration speech.However, there are Republicans calling Trump out on what he did to Mika Brzezinski. Almost universally, his comments were condemned. However, the GOP, with Trump as its standard-bearer, is defined by misogyny and all of his other bigoted opinions. He IS your party. That didn t stop GOP pundits who are not elected officials from criticizing him and the party harshly, though. Perhaps most prominently are CNN contributor and GOP strategist Ana Navarro and MSNBC s host of Deadline: White House Nicolle Wallace. Here are both of those proud Republican women s statements on Trump s latest antics. First, Nicolle Wallace, who sent some very good advice to the White House and Republicans everywhere that most likely will definitely not be taken:As a former WH comms director, my thoughts to the President s tweets: https://t.co/hhDNMWeAmL  Nicolle Wallace (@NicolleDWallace) June 29, 2017Now, Ana Navarro s stinging response on CNN with Wolf Blitzer and others, amid a montage of outraged responses: This dude has got such a fixation with women and blood.

You always had an issue with racism, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. That must be addressed, and it will continue until you do it. The thing the respectable members that are left of the GOP must recognize is this, though: with Donald Trump as your standard-bearer, those sentiments ARE the GOP. I know how much a part of one s identity a political party can be. I am a lifelong, dyed-in-the-wool Democrat. I d be HOWLING if anyone tried to force me to go Independent. However, if the Democrats ever came up with their own version of Donald Trump, I like to think I d run for the hills as fast as my fat little legs could carry me because my country will ALWAYS come before my party. I really hope you all have the stones to do the same in this instance.Remember, Republicans   history will judge you on who you associated with and how you handled the Trump era.

The nation watched in helpless horror as he coarsened our political discourse, encouraged violence at his rallies, attacked a Gold Star family, kicked off the whole campaign with anti-immigrant, white nationalist rhetoric that painted all Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, and much more. Then, with childish pet names and taunts, he decimated the traditional GOP candidates one by one and clinched the Republican nomination.As Trump carried the mantle of the GOP, the party brass desperately hoped that he would no longer be the crude, crass, racist, misogynist, xenophobic, disgusting man they had seen in the primary campaign. They hoped that he we would pivot, to no avail. Then, in a shocking political upset, Trump actually won the presidency via America s draconian Electoral College system, which was actually created to appease southern slave owners, and should have been dismantled long ago. Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million, yet she did not get to take the White House. The nation has suffered both at home and on the world stage for this.In Trump s latest outrage, just shy of six months into his presidency, Trump has again sunk to another low, and launched an incredibly misogynistic, disgusting attack on his one-time friend, Morning Joe co-host Mika Brzezinski. Trump, a lifelong New Yorker, has finally gotten his wish, but likely not in the way he imagined.

He referenced Trump s insistence that he told the Morning Joe hosts he was attacked  No!  when they supposedly wanted to go to his party on New Year s Eve, saying: Said no to what?

He is a disgusting, bigoted misogynist who does the nation harm on an hourly basis.Cut the cord, GOP.

1,Fake,"June 29, 2017",News,"An explosive report in the Wall Street Journal explicitly links the Russian-hacked Clinton campaign emails with Trump s campaign   and Michael Flynn s chances of ending up in prison just skyrocketed.According to the report, a GOP operative, Peter Smith, who had worked with Flynn s consulting group asked computer experts to help him get a hold of the cache of hacked emails the Russian government stole from Clinton s campaign. To open doors to getting what he wanted, he name-dropped Michael Flynn, who at that point was working on Trump s campaign. Smith died recently, but not before handing the Wall Street Journal a bedside confession of sorts.Talking Points Memo summarizes the insane details of the scheme:In one recruiting email reviewed by the newspaper, Smith said Flynn s son, Michael G. Flynn, was helping with the effort. In another, Jonathan Safron, a law student who worked for Smith, included Flynn s consulting firm, Flynn Intel Group, at the top of a list of websites of people working with the team. He said,  I m talking to Michael Flynn about this if you find anything, can you let me know?  Eric York, one computer security expert who said he searched hacker forums on Smith s behalf to try to dig up the emails, told the Journal.Here s where the other shoe drops, via WSJ:Those investigators have examined reports from intelligence agencies that describe Russian hackers discussing how to obtain emails from Mrs. Clinton s server and then transmit them to Mr. Flynn via an intermediary, according to U.S. officials with knowledge of the intelligence.It isn t clear who that intermediary might have been or whether Mr. Smith s operation was the one allegedly under discussion by the Russian hackers. The reports were compiled during the same period when Mr. Smith s group was operating, according to the officials.Trump actively encouraged Russian hackers to steal Clinton s documents during the campaign, but later claimed to not have anything to do with their release. Despite the denials, a mountain of circumstantial evidence and a number of questionable admissions from Trump s team have only stoked the flames that something was very wrong during the election. Much of his staff, including Vice President Mike Pence and Trump s own personal lawyer, have hired defense attorneys in preparation for the investigation into their involvement.This new information only further incriminates Flynn, who now goes from looking  pretty guilty  to  very guilty.  It also burns the last remaining bridges he may have had to save himself.Michael Flynn has toyed with taking a deal to turn on his former boss, but the FBI says it is not pursuing that relationship. There is a good possibility that, if these allegations bear fruit, Flynn winds up in jail for treason or something close to it.Now all eyes have turned to Trump himself, who seems consumed with protecting Flynn. By his own retelling, Trump fired then FBI Director, James Comey, because he wouldn t stop the Russia investigation. Comey has since testified that Trump specifically asked him to drop any investigation into Flynn (who has by now retroactively filed as a foreign agent working for Turkey s despotic regime).Spies, hackers, foreign agents, liars, thieves, and crooks   quite a group assembled by Trump, the man who only hires the best people.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images", GOP Operative Connected To Trump’s Ousted Top Adviser Tried Obtaining Russian-Hacked Clinton Emails

Instead, it s a compilation of stories from the web   mostly from right-wing sources such as Breitbart and Fox   that are flattering to Trump.On Thursday, for example, a Forbes contributor argued the Congressional Budget Office was wrong in calculating that 22 million people would lose health insurance under Trumpcare. According to them, no one would lose insurance.Reality check! An analysis by Forbes contributor Josh Archambault reveals surprising flaws in the CBO s score of the Senate healthcare bill, which concludes 22 million more Americans will be without health coverage by 2026. As Archambault points out, the CBO score is based on an old, inaccurate 2016 CBO estimate of how many Americans will purchase Obamacare. If you use their January 2017 update, Republican legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare would result in only 2 million fewer on the individual market by 2026, and would actually result in no losses and even some gains in enrollment in the years preceding, Archambault estimates.

The entire GOP needs to rebuke Trump for what he is doing on Twitter, and one Democratic Congresswoman is pointing that out, Rep. Barbara Lee of California.Taking to Trump s favorite medium of communication, Twitter, Rep. Lee called on her GOP colleagues to stop excusing Trump s behavior and standing by him, for his words are having a terribly negative impact on the impressionable children of America. Rep.

It is also about the Republican Party s crazy tolerance and even acceptance of open and overt misogyny.This isn t just about Trump. We already knew he has no respect for women. It s also about the GOP   which continues to defend & support him.  Rep. Barbara Lee (@RepBarbaraLee) June 29, 2017Then again, the GOP has long been an anti-woman party. It is there in their policies, in their refusal to vote for the protection of domestic violence victims or in favor of equal pay for women, and their constant and unending stream of assaults on women s reproductive healthcare. In a way, that makes Trump the perfect standard-bearer for their party.Besides all of that, the party is largely made up of old, craven, white men, who couldn t care less about the well-being of women.

That was Trump s spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee s take: This is a president who fights fire with fire and certainly will not be allowed to be bullied by the liberal media and the liberal elites in the media, or Hollywood, or anywhere else. Meanwhile, experts have repeatedly warned that Donald Trump exhibits the  textbook  signs of a bully himself.Parry Aftab, a lawyer who leads the Internet safety group WiredSafety, said Mr. Trump s behavior was a textbook example of cyberbullying.In particular, she said his methods were characteristic of  mean-girl cyberbullying  because he enlists others to mimic his attacks. She said his conduct resembled the violent and abusive language her organization can often get removed from Facebook and Twitter.Indeed, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg had to personally intervene on Trump s behalf and ensure none of Trump s Facebook posts were deleted for violating hate speech rules during the election because his messages often crossed the line.Trump is a man consumed by a rage directed at his critics   and it burns most brightly at his female critics. Infamously, he made attacking Megyn Kelly the centerpiece of his campaign, including shots at her menstruation cycle. It is no surprise, then, that he s turned his rage towards Mika Brzezinksi.Sadly, it s also no surprise that Melania is choosing to stand by her sexist husband rather than with a fellow woman.Featured image via Twitter", Melania Pauses Anti-Bullying Initiative To Say Her Husband Is Allowed To Mock Women’s IQ And Looks

We ve got hundreds of thousands of Americans to take care of.Or do we? We re all going to die anyway. At least, according to Fox News.Fox News has presented the best argument to the health insurance problem on Wednesday by revealing that we will all one day die so it doesn t matter. We can all pack up and go home   everything is solved. You know what the crazy thing is?  Lisa Kennedy Montgomery said to her fellow hosts, chuckling after each soundbite from the Democrats.  We re all gonna die. And they can t predict there, there s no way, unless they re absolutely psychic and have a party line to heaven, they don t know who is going to die, or when, or how many people! This revelation and chuckling came after airing statements from Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, in which they warn that cutting health care access for at least 22 million people by 2026 a figure the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released this week   could result in thousands of deaths across the nation.I guess when you get down to it, the genius of this argument is pretty funny. It s so simple!Newsweek points out that multiple studies over the course of decades have consistently reflected a decrease in deaths from treatable diseases when there is increased access to coverage. A New England Journal of Medicine report states  the largest decreases [in death rates] were for deaths from  health care amenable  conditions such as heart disease, infections and cancer, which are more plausibly affected by access to medical care. Beginning with the Institute of Medicine s 2002 report  Care Without Coverage,  some analyses have suggested that lack of insurance causes tens of thousands of deaths each year in the United States,  the journal wrote in its report,  Health Insurance Coverage and Health What the Recent Evidence Tells Us. Several quasi experimental studies using population-level data and longer follow-up offer more precise estimates of coverage s effect on mortality,  it continues.  One study compared three states implementing large Medicaid expansions in the early 2000s to neighboring states that didn t expand Medicaid, finding a significant 6 percent decrease in mortality over five years of follow-up. Source: NewsweekIn other words, the personalities on Fox News are completely lost. Do people genuinely watch Fox News? Do they really soak all this in?

But Amazon lost that battle, and recently has been adding states where it does pay sales tax.Amazon now pays sales tax in all 45 states that have a sales tax.

Trump has refused to release his tax returns and the only tax return we have seen shows that Trump may not have had to pay federal income taxes for two decades after he wrote off a $900 million business loss.Furthermore, Trump is currently suing the town of Briarcliff Manor, New York in an effort to force the town to cut the property taxes on his $38 million Westchester golf course and resort. Trump currently pays just $500,000, but he is trying to pay only half that amount by devaluing the worth of his own property despite bragging that it was worth $50 million on his 2016 financial disclosure forms.Trump has been disputing the taxes in court for years even though the town already gave him a generous tax break in 2008.

Mitch McConnell (R-KY) called for the vote on the GOP s health care bill to be delayed until after the July 4 recess, Donald Trump met with GOP senators in a closed-door meeting to discuss how the failing bill might be saved. There s just one major problem: Trump doesn t know what the f*ck he s talking about! In fact, he probably doesn t even know what is in the bill.The New York Times recapped the meeting, and hidden in the report was a certain gem from an anonymous senate staffer who was present in the meeting. The account from this staffer truly proves that Trump is running the country blind and has no idea what s going on. The staffer said: A senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy. This senate staffer also said that Trump seemed oblivious to the fact that the health care bill had tax implications, because in the meeting the POTUS said he would handle tax reform at a later time. Considering that Trump doesn t read and is incapable of focusing his attention on anything besides tweets, it s highly possible that Trump hasn t even looked at this health care bill.To make matters even worse, Trump demonstrated a delusional sense of comfort when he declared the meeting a success on Twitter. Trump tweeted: I just finished a great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare. They really want to get it right, unlike OCare!

Despite four losses in special elections to replace members of Congress that went to work in Trump s cabinet from deep red districts, it seems that the Democratic base is not ready to give up on our current leader in the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi.This comes after a wave of Democratic members of Congress have floated the idea of getting rid of Pelosi in favor of fresh blood. Members of the House Democratic Caucus like Tim Ryan (D-OH) have been calling for Leader Pelosi s head after the loss of the Great Democratic Hope in Trump Country, Jon Ossoff of Georgia s 6th district. However, a new poll shows that fewer than three in ten Democratic voters want Pelosi going anywhere.The poll is recent   conducted between June 22 and June 24, polling 1,984 self-identified rank and file Democrats. This is smart, because we need a strong, experienced leader to resist the Trump agenda in Congress. Pelosi can fundraise and whip votes like no other. This is not the time to rip ourselves to shreds out of fear of every candidate we run being painted as a clone of Nancy Pelosi. Remember, they ll do that to any Democrat. Their best weapon is to have us infighting and tearing one another down.There really isn t a whole lot of daylight policy wise between the progressive populist wing and the supposed center left.

1,Fake,"June 28, 2017",News,"The Republicans are at it again   this time by passing a bill that will allow public schools in Kentucky to teach the Bible.WDRB reports that the man responsible for this is Gov. Matt Bevin. It was publicly signed at the Capitol on Tuesday. The bill, which easily passed the House and Senate, gives local school boards the option of developing a Bible literacy class as part of their social studies curriculum. The course is also meant to be an elective and not required.The bill s sponsor said students need to understand the role the Bible played in American history. It really did set the foundation that our founding fathers used to develop documents like the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights,  said Rep. D.J. Johnson (R-Owensboro).  All of those came from principles from the Bible. Is actually examining the Bible truly necessary to look at American history? Will it even be an examination of the Bible? What about other religious texts? It smells more like a guise to teach the Bible as if it s Sunday School in public schools.I m not the only one that thinks so, either. The ACLU of Kentucky said it s concerned about how the law might be used in schools. A Bible literacy bill that, on its face, may not appear to be unconstitutional, could in fact become unconstitutional in its implementation,  said Advocacy Director Kate Miller.  We want to make sure that teachers can teach and make sure that they don t go in to preach,  Miller said.Miller told WDRB News the ACLU will monitor the law closely.Honestly, if religion is that important to you, stick your child in private school. If you think you can t, find a way. The idea that we would not want this to be an option for people in school, that would be crazy. I don t know why every state would not embrace this, why we as a nation would not embrace this,  Bevin told the crowd.Well, the answer should be obvious. Because public schools are not meant to be held to any one particular religion. Though people like to say this nation was founded on Christianity, it was actually founded on freedom of religion. People wanted to practice their beliefs freely without the beliefs of others shoved down their throats.Unfortunately, all we can do is watch, wait, and hope that this bill will be in the trash before long.Featured image via Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images", Public Schools In Kentucky Can Now “Teach” The Bible

DianeW (@BellaLuna468) June 28, 2017It s odd that Hannity supports WikiLeaks, an entity who supposedly believes in the transparency of governments, yet the idea of a transparent Trump administration rattles him to the core. The Russia probe is not being reported accurately on Fox News and the network has begun losing its key demographics. Breitbart.com has fallen from 45th place to 281st place in news site traffic ratings as the right-wing site ignores Trump s massive scandals. Hannity, a conspiracy theorist, is using CNN to bash the press. Three journalists resigned and an inaccurate story was retracted. Meanwhile, Sean Hannity pushed the baseless Seth Rich murder conspiracy theory. That prompted advertisers to flee from his show. So, it s kind of cute that Hannity calls other outlets  fake news.

1,Fake,"June 28, 2017",News,"Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke with CNN s Erin Burnett on Tuesday and accidentally spilled the beans about the kind of healthcare American really needs. While explaining his position on the latest healthcare plan drummed up by the GOP, he talked himself into a corner by describing a system of healthcare that sounds a lot like single payer.Paul was exchanging healthcare views with Erin Burnett when she realized that he accidentally made the point for nationalized healthcare, so she pressed him hard using his own words against him. We should try to give them options,  he explained while making the case for individual markets. He used the example of a how a plumber could link up with additional plumbers and create one large group market that covers all cases, including things like pregnancy. You could get a way out of that individual conundrum and you could get group policies, and most of the group policies actually have things like pregnancy,  Paul continued.  If you work for General Motors, my guess is pregnancy is automatically in your insurance because you are a big group and you have the leverage to demand it. Burnett took the argument for a collective large group insurance and ran with it. So why not go for the biggest group of all and just have insurance for everybody?  She retorted. Well, socialism s not a good idea,  said Paul, using the Venezuelan health crisis as a model for socialism s failures.Burnet slammed back,  But you did make a great argument for nationalized healthcare. You said  the bigger the group the lower the cost,  so I m taking your argument to its logical conclusion. Paul then tried to take back what he said.  I was talking about voluntary groups, not the gulag. Too late, Paul. You brought up the real solution to the healthcare crisis without even realizing what you were saying.

Within 24 hours, he was on Twitter having a spittle-laden meltdown over the negative coverage he s been receiving. Two articles   one by the New York Times and the other by the Washington Post   seem to have pushed him over the edge.First, there was the New York Times, which found a number of Senate Republicans willing to call him a moron:Senate Republican leadership has made it known that it would much rather negotiate with Mr. Pence than a president whose candidacy many did not even take seriously during the 2016 primaries. And some of the White House s efforts have clearly been counterproductive.Then there was the Washington Post, which discovered that Trump had photoshopped a picture of himself onto the cover TIME magazine and hung it in his golf courses.The framed copy of Time magazine was hung up in at least five of President Trump s clubs, from South Florida to Scotland. Filling the entire cover was a photo of Donald Trump. Donald Trump: The  Apprentice  is a television smash!  the big headline said. Above the Time nameplate, there was another headline in all caps:  TRUMP IS HITTING ON ALL FRONTS . . . EVEN TV! But that wasn t true.The Time cover is a fake.There was no March 1, 2009, issue of Time magazine.

1,Fake,"June 28, 2017",News,"Donald Trump woke up on Wednesday morning and lashed out at the media again.The temper tantrum was aimed at the New York Times because they talked to a Republican senator who attended a meeting at the White House Trump organized to discuss the healthcare bill.Earlier this week, the Congressional Budget Office reported that the Trumpcare bill will cause 22 million Americans to lose their insurance and that premiums would skyrocket by 74 percent on top of taking away many of the protections that the Affordable Care Act currently provides.Faced with heavy opposition to the Republican repeal effort, Trump invited Senate Republicans to the White House to discuss the matter. It did not go well. The meeting went off the rails because, the senators found, Trump doesn t know a damn thing about the bill.According to the New York Times,A senator who supports the bill left the meeting at the White House with a sense that the president did not have a grasp of some basic elements of the Senate plan   and seemed especially confused when a moderate Republican complained that opponents of the bill would cast it as a massive tax break for the wealthy.Again, the Times spoke to a person who was actually at the meeting.But Trump whined about the report anyway and complained that the Times did not call him to confirm the story, which we all know he would not have done because Trump thinks any news story about his incompetence is  fake news.

1,Fake,"June 28, 2017",News,"Protests against Trumpcare are ramping up now that the Congressional Budget Office has released their assessment of the bill. And not surprisingly, Republican senators are sinking to all-time lows to avoid the angry constituents begging for the GOP not to take away their health care. Last week they were dragging people out of wheelchairs to haul them off to jail and this week they re throwing priests behind bars.Six protesters were arrested on Monday for protesting the repeal of Obamacare at Sen. Shelley Moore Capito s office in Charleston, WV, who has yet to decide how she will vote on the bill. One of the protestors who ended up in handcuffs was Rev. Jim Lewis. For the party that claims to be all about Christian values, it sure is ironic that they having a man of God arrested because he asked them not to kill the poor and sick. Just saying.The Washington Journal reports:So, for six hours, several dozen West Virginians stood outside the office calling for their Junior Senator to protect their healthcare, while six went into Capito s office and staged a sit-in. At 5:30 pm, protesters inside were told that the office was closing and they would be arrested if they did not leave.The videos below, livestreamed on Facebook, show the protesters calmly and peacefully explaining their cause and the disaster they were committed to avoiding. Police officers   seemingly with reluctance, if not sympathy   told them they would be charged with trespassing and taken to jail if they did not leave.Committed to the moral imperative that is stopping Trumpcare, the protesters made clear that if the choice was between jail or backing down, the decision was easy.Gary Zuckett, executive director of the West Virginia Citizen Action Group which helped organize the event along with West Virginia Citizen Action Group, Rise Up West Virginia and Kanawha Valley Democratic Socialists of America, said they were there to try to get through to Capito just how many of her constituents will be hurt if this bill becomes law. The idea is, we need to send a message to Sen. Capito that this is not an acceptable direction for our country to be going,  he said.  It s going to hurt West Virginia, it s going to hurt our economy, it s going to put a lot of the rural health clinics at risk, it may close some rural hospitals. It s definitely going to harm her constituents when they lose their health care coverage, especially with the Medicaid expansion.

Trump s team has insisted that they will write the speech given by the president s robot at the attraction.The source explained to Vice, When Disney tried to get this process started earlier this year, Trump s people said,  We ll be writing the speech that the president s audio-animatronic figure will be saying.' For the last two decades, a robot of the current president gives a speech at the end of the attraction. In the past, Disney employees have worked together with presidential teams to write appropriate addresses. The source explained to Vice that: The Imagineers [the researchers and developers behind Disney s theme park attractions] tried to point out that they re typically involved with this process. That they directly collaborated with Clinton, Bush, and Obama s people when it came to figuring out what the president s audio-animatronic figure would say. Trump s people said,  No. We re writing this speech. You guys have no input on this.' Vice s source says that Disney is afraid of a park boycott of Trump decided to take his disagreement out to Twitter. They d particularly like to avoid him tweeting about this situation.

1,Fake,"June 28, 2017",News,"Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates was fired by Donald Trump when she refused to defend his travel ban, which we all know is nothing more than a Muslim ban. On Tuesday, she explained to attendees at the Aspen Ideas Festival in Colorado why it was that she couldn t bring herself to argue that this bill wasn t based on religion. I came ultimately to the conclusion that our defending this travel ban would require me to send lawyers of the Justice Department to court to say this ban had nothing to do with religion   (that) it was all based on national security, nothing to do with religion,  Yates told the audience. And I did not believe that to be a defense that was grounded in truth and I couldn t send Department of Justice lawyers in to defend something based on a defense that I did not believe was grounded in truth. The Trump administration did not consult the Justice Department while crafting the ban and Yates didn t even know about it until she got a call from her principal deputy who had read about it in the New York Times. That was on a Friday evening. She studied the bill as much as she could over the weekend and then convened a meeting with  lifetime civil department staffers, holdover employees from President Obama s time in office and newly-hired Trump staff.  Her question to them was simple: How would you defend Trump s travel ban? We went around the table with my asking them,  All right, tell me why you think this is lawful? How are we going to defend this?'  Yates said.  Without revealing our internal discussions here, at the end of that, I was not comfortable that it was, in fact, lawful or constitutional and kept the senior Trump appointee back to tell him I was very uncomfortable where we were. After speaking to several other people about the Muslim ban, Yates said she just couldn t defend it. So, Trump fired her like he fires anybody who doesn t kiss his a** and tell him that he can do no wrong.

1,Fake,"June 27, 2017",News,"According to a new report, health insurance premiums will shoot up 74% for the Average American under the health care bill being served up by the Republican Senate. Older customers will be hit even harder with some paying twice as much for plans comparable to what they currently have.The nonpartisan group Kaiser Family Foundation analyzed the costs for individual market plans that cover 70% of medical costs   what most Obamacare plans cover   and factored in insurance prices and subsidies under the Republican bill.Mitch McConnel s health bill encourages customers to purchase plans with high deductibles, reduces subsidies for lower-income Americas, and allows insurers to charge older people more.These changes would result in plans varying dramatically due to age and income, with low-income and older persons suffering the most.People between 55 and 64 would see an increase of 115$ on average, which is more than double the Obama care prices. Low-income Americans who make less than $24,000 a year would receive an increase of 177$, versus only 57% for people that bring in more money.Younger and higher income Americans will see less sweeping changes in their insurance premiums.Customers who have the disadvantage of being bother older and low-income will see premiums go up 294%, an increase of almost fourfold.The Senior Vice President for Special Initiatives at Kaiser Family Foundation, Larry Levitt, weighed in on the drastic situation. Faced with premiums almost quadrupling, many of these low-income adults would tend to either go without coverage entirely because it s unaffordable or gravitate towards a plan with lower premiums and higher deductibles. The Congressional Budget Office even admits this bill is going to be disastrous for Americans. Their own analysis concluded that premiums will most likely be too high for low-income Americans to purchase coverage, causing millions more to be stranded without insurance than under the current health care law.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images", Brace Yourself For 74 Percent Higher Health Care Premiums Under New Bill
1,Fake,"June 27, 2017",News,"The Congressional Budget Office released their report on the Senate s version of the Republican  health care  bill on Monday, and it was not good news. According to their analysis, a whopping 22 million Americans will lose their insurance coverage if the bill becomes law. But that is not the extent of the cruelty in this legislation.The CBO report revealed that much like the House version, the Senate bill is especially callous when it comes to the lives of those who are sick, disabled, or elderly   you know, the people that need health care the most.If the bill were to pass, older Americans would see their premiums skyrocket. Under Obamacare, the average cost of insurance coverage for a 64-year-old with an income of $56,800 is $6,800 annually. But under the Senate bill, dubbed the Better Care Reconciliation Act, that same 64-year-old would see their premiums rise to $20,500 per year. That means 36 percent of grandma s income will be going to insurance premiums, which does not include the costs of co-pays, deductibles, etc.CBO analysis BCRA premiums, via TwitterThe big brag of this bill is that it will lower premiums for the young and middle-aged (a little bit), assuming they are healthy, of course. But here s the thing, no one stays young and healthy forever. Some might argue that the whole point of having health care is so you have the opportunity to get old in the first place.Unless you die a tragic death before your time (probably from gun violence if you are in the U.S., but I digress), you are going to get old. That much is a guarantee. It s an either-or thing, not a maybe. And the chances are pretty good that sooner or later, you are going to get sick. Which, once again, is the whole point of having health insurance to begin with. But under the GOP bill, getting sick means you now have one of those nifty pre-existing condition things.So no matter how you look at it, the only way to avoid paying sky-high premiums under the BCRA is to die. This bill may be a lot of things, but it sure as hell isn t  health care. Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images", Grandma Will Have To Pay More Than $20k A Year For Insurance Under GOP Bill

On Tuesday, Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee attended the first on-camera press briefing in over a week   only to begin a disgustingly, dishonest smear of the free press.People watching in horror as Trump and his team undermine the media s ability to have a check on their power have been begging reporters to stand up for themselves and their duties   and one finally did.In a powerful moment, Brian Karem of The Sentinel, couldn t take it anymore.
